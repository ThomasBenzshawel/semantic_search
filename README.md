# Semantic Search Demo Application
Setup instructions:
1. Download this repo
2. Delete the "application" directory and the "package-lock.json" and "package.json" files (I couldn't be bothered to remove them from the repo)
3. In the main working directory, run "npx create-react-app application", and copy the two files from the "React App Files" directory into the new application/src directory, overwriting the two that exist in there already
4. Run a pip install from the requirements.txt file

To run:
1. Run "npm start" in the "application" directory
2. Run the server.py file located in the "backend_application/structure" directory
