1.The general anatomical features of the digestive tube are listed below. Fill in the table to complete the information.

Organs of the Alimentary Canal
2.The tubelike digestive system canal that extends from the mouth to the anus is the canal.
3.How is the muscularis externa of the stomach modified? 
How does this modification relate to the function of the stomach? 
4.What transition in epithelium type exists at the gastroesophageal junction? 
How do the epithelia of these two organs relate to their specific functions? 
5.Differentiate between the colon and the large intestine. NAME ___________________________________ LAB TIME/DATE _______________________
1) epithelium absorption
2) lamina propria secretion
3) muscularis mucosa
(not applicable) vascular supply for mucosa; protection
1) circular layer churning; mixing; propulsion of food along the tract
2) longitudinal layer
(not applicable) protection
alimentary
It has a third (obliquely oriented) muscle layer.
Vigorous churning activity occurs here.
Changes from stratified squamous (esophagus) to
simple columnar (stomach)
The esophagus is subjected to constant abrasion
(stratified squamous is well adapted for this). The stomach has secretory (and some absorptive) functions.
The large intestine includes the colon, but also includes the cecum, ver-
miform appendix, rectum, and anal canal.ighapmLre38pg295_300  5/12/04  3:25 PM  Page 295 impos03 302:bjighapmL:ighapmLrevshts:layouts:

swallowing

, , 8. three structures continuous with and repre-
senting modifications of the peritoneum

13. valve at the junction of the small and large intestines
14. primary region of food and water absorption
15. membrane securing the tongue to the floor of the mouth
16. absorbs water and forms feces
17. area between the teeth and lips/cheeks
18. wormlike sac that outpockets from the cecum
19. initiates protein digestion
20. structure attached to the lesser curvature of the stomach
21. organ distal to the stomach
22. valve controlling food movement from the stomach into the 
duodenum
23. posterosuperior boundary of the oral cavity
24. location of the hepatopancreatic sphincter through which pancre-
atic secretions and bile pass
25. serous lining of the abdominal cavity wall
26. principal site for the synthesis of vitamin K by microorganisms
27. region containing two sphincters through which feces are expelled
