In the early 1990 s, many accounts of denial of service, discrimination  and mistreatment  from African 
Americans who visited Denny s came forth.  This resulted in two class-action lawsuits that accused 
Denny's of repeated civil rights violations , including:
 Requiring African Americans to prepay for meals, 
 Limiting the number of African American patrons during certain  times,
 Denying complimentary "birthday meals" for African American s, and
 Forcing the removal of African Americans from its restaurants.


The problem was systemic, as evidenced by other practices. Denn y's had only one African American 
franchisee and had no minority suppliers in the early 1990s. Denny's board of directors consisted 
almost exclusively of white men .
