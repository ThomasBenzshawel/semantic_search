U.C.C.   2-207:  Battle of the Forms Flow Chart / Ap proach 
 
 
 
If Same Terms exist in both the 
Offer and the Acceptance, then a 
contract is created on the terms of 
the Offer and the Acceptance.  
No UCC   2-207 issue exists.   - If Additional  or Different Terms  exist between the 
Offer and the Acceptance, then a UCC   2-207 issue 
exists.  Go on to the next two possible scenarios:   
A definite and seasonable  expression of 
acceptance was given (i.e. if offeree clearly 
accepted)?  If so, then go on to examine the 
possible 2 scenarios about that acceptance: 
If so, a contract is not created by  the 
exchange of Offer and Acceptance 
under UCC   2-207(1).   
 
But a contract may still be created by 
conduct.  Ask if the facts fall within the 
following the next 2 scenarios: A definite and seasonable  expression 
of acceptance was NOT  given (i.e. if 
offeree didn t clearly accept).  
Parties  conduct 
indicates existence 
of a contract?   Parties  conduct 
does not indicate 
existence of a 
contract?   
If so, then a 
contract by conduct 
exists under UCC   
2-207(3). No contract 
exists.  Acceptance IS NOT  expressly conditional 
on assent to different or additional terms.  Acceptance IS expressly conditional on 
assent to different or additional terms.  
Consequently, the 
terms of the contract 
are those terms that 
are a mirror-image of 
one another. 
Conflicting and 
additional terms are 
knocked out and 
replaced by UCC 
gapfillers).  UCC   2-
207(3). If so, then a contract  is created under UCC 
2-207(1).  But the additional and different 
terms will be determined by the following: 
ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR K 
BETWEEN 2 MERCHANTS:   If 
the contract is between 
merchants , additional terms are 
included in the contract unless :  
 
(a) the offer expressly limits 
acceptance to the terms of the 
offer; OR 
 
(b) the additional terms 
materially  alter the contract; OR  
 
(c) notification of objection to 
them has already by given or is 
given within a reasonable time 
after notice of them is received 
(UCC   2-207(2). 
DIFFERENT/CONFLICTING 
TERMS:   Different (Conflicting) 
terms are knocked out and 
replaced by UCC Article 2 gap-
fillers. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR K 
NOT BETWEEN MERCHANTS:   
If one or more parties is not a 
merchant , additional terms ARE 
NOT included in the contract 
unless that party s assent to 
inclusion of that term is separately 
expressed.  If so, acceptance operates as a 
counteroffer .  Go on to the 
following 2 scenarios below:   
If the other party 
expressly and 
unequivocally 
accepts additional 
and different 
terms, a contract is 
formed of terms of 
the counteroffer.  If the other 
party does not 
expressly & 
unequivocally 
accept, then a 
contract may 
still be formed 
by conduct 
under UCC   
2-207(3).  Go 
to the following 
analysis.   Always  start by asking whether the fact pattern shows that both Offer and 
Acceptance contains (1) the Same Terms; OR (2) Additional or Different Terms.
