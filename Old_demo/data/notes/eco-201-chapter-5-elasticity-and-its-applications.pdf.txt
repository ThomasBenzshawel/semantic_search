Chapter 5   Elasticity and Its Applications
Price elasticity of demand - a measure that indicates the degree of consumer response to a price 
change.
(% change in quantity)
(% change in price)
Midpoint Formula   Price elasticity of Demand (In notebook)
How to interpret the elasticity coefficient:
 If |Ed| > 1 demand is elastic
|% Q| > 1
|% P| or   |%  Q| > |% P|
 If |Ed| < 1 demand is inelastic
|% Q| < 1
|% P|
 If |Ed| = 1 demand is unitary elastic
II. Price Elasticity of Demand Graphically Elasticity and St raight-Line Demand Curves.
Slope and elasticity are not the same thing (two different numbe rs) 
BUT 
Comparing relative slopes of two demand curves allows you to compare e lasticity


Perfectly elastic is straight vertical line.
Determinants of elasticity of demand
Availability of substitutes
Is the good luxury or necessity?
The more time buyers have, to buy an item the more elastic the deman d is.
4) Definition of the Market: The more specific the classification for a  good, the more elastic the demand 
is.
Elasticity of supply
Measures producer s response to a price change
Es =  (% change in quantity supplied)
         -------------------------------------------
       (% change in price)
If Es > 1 supply is elastic
If Es < 1 supply is inelastic
If Es = 1 supply is unitary elastic
