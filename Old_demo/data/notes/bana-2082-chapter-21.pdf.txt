Chapter 2.1
For presentation and analysis data are the facts and figures obtained , evaluated and summarized. Table 
2.1 displays an inventory data collection in the Dow Jones Industr ial Index (or simply "Dow") on 25 June 
2019. Many investment advisors and investors watch the Dow as a n indicator of the current condition of 
the financial and economic markets in the United States. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which is
continuously monitored by virtually every financial publication, i s calculated based on the share prices of
the 30 companies listed in Table 2.1. Charles Dow and Edward Jone s, who introduced the measurement 
of the DJI in 1896, are named for the index.
Almost every challenge (and opportunity) facing an organiz ation (or individual) is concerned with the 
effect on the business result of the potential values of related varia bles. Therefore, we are concerned 
how the value of a variable varies; the difference in a variab le determined by observations (time, 
customers, objects, etc.).
The role of descriptive analytics is to collect and analysis data so that  variations and their effect on a 
business environment are better understood. The values of such vari ables are regulated directly by the 
decision maker (often called decision variables). The values of othe r variables may differ with uncertainty
due to factors beyond the decision-maker 's direct control. A quantit y whose values are uncertainly 
understood is commonly called a random or incomplete variable. Wh en we collect data, we collect 
previously observed values or accomplishments of a variable. Our pur pose is to learn how a specific 
business situation changes by collecting these past realizations of one or  more variables.
