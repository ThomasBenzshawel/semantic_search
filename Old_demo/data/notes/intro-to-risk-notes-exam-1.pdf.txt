 
CH 1: INTRO + OVERVIEW 
Risk management: decision making under circumstances 
Pure risk 
  Uncertainty = regarding events which could produce a lot 
  Can be losses for firms and/or individuals 
  In financial terms - money 
  Focus on Traditional Risk Management (TRM) 
  Losses can be known with certainty 
  A loss which is certain has 100% chance (ex: death and taxes) 
  If something is certain you might budget for it, not insure it 
  Impossible loss has 0% chance of happening (Ex: pigs fly) 
  No risk is present, no uncertainty about loss - budget, plan, and avoid the loss 
  Loss is present, no uncertainty about the loss 
  Risk does not equal loss 
Possibility of the loss 
  Chance of loss - odds 
  Prob ranges from 0 to 1 or 0% to 100% 
  Risk does not equal the prob of loss 
Pure Risk vs Speculative Risk 
  Both involve uncertainty 
  Difference is in the outcomes 
  The future states of the world 
Speculative risk 
  3 future states of the world: gain, loss, or no gain or loss 
  Ex: gambling, investment (stock), buying house 
  Basis for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Pure risk 
  2 future states of the world: loss, no gain or loss 
  Ex: fire, flood, death, sickness 
Static vs Dynamic Risk 
  Static: does not change significantly overtimes, always present 
  Ex: fire, weather, death, violence, car accidents 
  Dynamic: arises out of changing circumstances, new 
  Ex: cybersecurity, AI, drones, modern day terrorism, product liability i nsurance - 
driverless cars 
  As technology grows, risk gets bigger 
Diversifiable vs Non Diversifiable 
  Diversifiable - impacts some individuals, business, or groups (ex: fire) 
  Nondiversifiable - impacts only large segments in society at once (ex: natural dis asters, 
inflation, unemployment) 
Measurement of Risk 
  Subjective risk  


 
  an individual s view of uncertainty or the situation involving risk (ex: travel  on 
airplane) 
  Depends upon the individual - measures attitude towards risk 
  Not easily measured, not easy to compare among individuals 
  Risk lovers/takers, risk averse, or risk neutral 
  Influences how a firm or key decision maker will handle risky situations 
  Not everybody views the same exact situation the same way 
  Objective risk 
  Risk is uncertainty 
  Variation is key 
  Variation of actual outcomes around or about expected outcomes 
  Expected loss (EL) 
  Based on experience, data, or other means - what we expect to happen 
  Actual loss (AL) 
  Losses that actually occur 
  Problem: timing - we are uncertain what will happen and when 
Objective risk 
  Landlord A Landlord B 
  - 10 buildings     - 30 buildings 
  - expects 2 fires     - expects 9 fires 
  - 0 < # fires < 4     - 6 < # fires < 12 
  Who faces most risk? (always look at worst case scenario) 
  Probability or change of loss - does not equal risk 
  A = (2/10) = 20% 
  B = (9/30) = 30% 
  Variation of the loss - variation of actual from expected relative to 
expected: how we measure risk 
  = (AL - EL)/EL 
  A = (4-2)/2 = 100% 
  B = (12-9)/9 = 33% 
  A faces the most risk 
Sources of Pure Risk - Personal 
  Human capital 
  Personal pure risk 
  Our ability to generate income (anything that can get in the way of our ability to 
make money) 
  Subject to life and health exposure 
  injury/illness/death/disability 
  effects: 
  Loss of income or reduction of income 
  Increase in medical expenses 
  Most people under 30 do not consider or budget for these types of risk 
  retirement/unemployment (not able to work) 


 
  Loss or reduction of income 
  Possible higher medical expenses 
Sources of Pure Risk - Property and Liability 
  Ownership of financial or physical assets 
  theft/damage - property pure risk 
  Direct losses 
  Cost of replacing asset 
  Cost of repair 
  Ex: car accident - loss of car 
  Indirect losses 
  Extra expenses 
  Loss of income 
  Ex: car accident - late for class, lower grade, uber rides, loss of work 
paycheck 
  Wealth losses from liability exposure - liability pure risk 
  Judgement form lawsuit 
  Legal fees 
Factors That Affect Risk 
  Peril (actual cause of loss), not the  why,   it is the  what 
  Immediate cause of loss 
  If house catches on fire, peril = fire  
  Ex: fire, flood, theft, injury, sickness, death 
  Frequency of the loss 
  How often do losses occur 
  Severity of the loss 
  Given that a loss has occurred, how bad is it in $ terms 
  Severity is conditional upon frequency being positive 
  If frequency is 0, severity is not an issue 
  Hazard 
  Underlying condition lying behind a loss occurrence which either: 
  Increases frequency of the loss 
  Increases severity of the loss 
  Increases both frequency and severity 
  Smoking is a big hazard for lung cancer 
Factors Affecting Risk 
  Physical hazard 
  Location 
  If peril is flood, living at the beach is a physical hazard (frequency) 
  If peril is fire, distance to a fire hydrant is a physical hazard (severit y) 
  Construction - what it is made of 
  If peril is fire, wood structure is a physical hazard (frequency and severity)  
  Use - what the building being used for can pose a hazard 
  University classroom vs a church 


 
  If peril is fire, the use of building as a church poses a physical hazard 
  Churches don t have security - everyone can go in and out: better 
chance for someone to set building on fire 
Moral hazard 
  Where behavior changes because insurance exists 
  Frequency or severity increases because of existence of insurance 
  Odds of risk change because of moral hazard 
  Not illegal, not fraud 
  Moral hazard -  classic example  of fraud and dishonesty 
  Insurance fraud 
  Have your car  stolen  and collect insurance 
  Arson 
  Burn down your own building and collect insurance 
  Spouse kills spouse to collect insurance 
  Common thread of moral hazard: 
  Change in behavior 
  Existence of insurance 
  Moral hazard in health insurance 
  Two individuals that have the same health 
  Individuals who have insurance consume more healthcare than those who do not 
have insurance 
  Price is fixed for someone with insurance 
  Lowers user cost 
  Lower price - increased demand 
  Nothing to do with bad behavior - but changes occur because of insurance 
  Costly activity - you pay more for auto or car insurance - or taxes 
  Insurance fraud is not moral hazard, it is only and example of it. Not all moral hazard it 
illegal or fraud 
Morale Hazard 
  careless concerning losses 
  has nothing to do with the existence of insurance 
  ex: texting while driving 
Financial Burden and Consequences of Risk - 3 elements 
  what does risk truly cost and organization? 
  how does it impact the organization? 
  how can that impact society? 
  case study: Temple faces risk from Spring Fling 
  expected cost of loss - money that comes from losses 
  damages to infrastructure, damaged students 
  ex: 
  financial losses - lawsuits and legal fees 
  goodwill loss - loss of reputation as a university, maybe revenue 
goes down (creates a lower attendance rate) 


 
  cost to manage / risk management expenditures - the money you spend to deal 
with #1 
  ex: safety program, police security, training, buy insurance 
  residual uncertainty - loss of goods or services because they are  too risky  
  ex: society maybe losses something valuable, Spring Fling cancelled 
  because of medical malpractice and high infant/children insurance rates, 
lots of hospitals shut down maternity section 
 
TOPIC 2: RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
Decision Making Process 
  manage pure risk (TRM) and speculative risk (ERM) 
  goal is to minimize the financial impact on organization 
  goal isn t to make money, but minimize how much you lose 
Risk Management Function in an Organization 
  risk management - specialized branch of financial management 
  finance department deals with risk for small organizations 
  risk manager deals with risk in medium organizations 
  Chief Risk Officer (CRO) manages risk in large organizations 
  need to be independent from finance 
  risk management is continuously evolving 
  risk management does not equal buying insurance 
  buying insurance is a tool of risk management 
Evolution of Risk Management 
  1950s form did not manage risk - just bought insurance - very narrow and not strategic 
   insurance buyer  - job title 
  Mid 60s Professor Wayne Snider (Temple) helps coin the term of risk management 
  after that - it becomes a strategy 
  present - very important in a firm - very broad  
  growing in forms because more organizations have more and more risk to 
manage 
Steps in Risk Management Process 
1. identification to loss - failure of class ($2k) 
2. evaluate exposures to loss - take class more seriously than others 
3. identify possible alternatives - go to office hours, study, come to class, pay  attention, 
drop class 
4. select among the alternatives - pick 
5. implementation of chosen topics (s) - implement, have to actually do it 
6. re-evaluate periodically to the chosen strategies - check to see if alternatives ar e 
working, definition of insanity 
Step One: Identify Loss Exposure 
  anytime something happens and costs you money 
  tripped and broke leg, icy road and slide off and hit a tree and damaged car 


 
  Loss exposure - possibility of a financial loss that a particular entity faces  as the result of 
peril striking a thing of value 
  The most crucial step in the risk management process, other steps rely on it 
  Failure to properly identify can lead to bankruptcy - Big 6 accounting firm -> B ig 4 
How to Identify Exposures 
1. Inspections to plant and facility -  walk arounds  - physical inspections 
a. Slippery steps, open wire 
2. Contract analysis 
a. Leases 
b. Hold harmless agreement - volunteer to accept liability in a situation 
i. Frat and university accepts all liability for any injury as a result of bounce 
house accident 
ii. Eagles make Temple University accept all liability for anything that may 
go wrong at Temple football game 
3. Look at past information - won t apply for dynamic risks 
4. Share loss information with other similar firms through trade associations - 
benchmarking 
5. checklists/standardized surveys from insurance companies 
a.  How old is your water heater  
b.  Do you have cracks in your sidewalk  
6. Flow chart approach - process analysis 
a. Understand step by step process to understand what impacts and possible risks 
or outcomes 
7. Ask employees and managers in the firm 
8. Financial statement approach - what do I have to lose? 
a. Balance sheet: lists assets - physical, non physical 
b. Liabilities: who owes us money and can they repay it? 
c. Incomes statement: where does my money come from? 
d. Budget 
Categories of Loss Exposures 
  Property 
  Net Income 
  Personnel 
  Liability 
Property Loss Exposures 
  Real property: land building 
  Personal property 
  Tangible: equipment, furniture, clothes, accounting records 
  Intangible: goodwill, patent, trademark, copyright, account receivables 
  Legal interest in property 
  Financial interest or stake in property 
  If there is a loss to the property, you will also suffer a loss 
Situations Giving Rise to Interest in Property 


 
  Ownership interest 
  Most common type of interest 
  Can have present or future ownership interest 
  Owning a house, until mortgage is paid off you don t own it yet: future (car 
and any other loans are also future) 
  Buyers and Sellers 
  When it comes to shipping products 
  FOB point - where the contract specifies the ownership changes hands 
  eBay ex: owners are not liable for anything that happens after it is received by 
the carrier 
  Bailee Interest 
  A bailee is an entity who receives property from another under a contract of 
bailment - needs to have exchange for $ 
  When you drop anything off to get repaired 
  Interest for the bailee is a legal liability to return or cost replacement of pr operty 
  Valet drivers have an interest to return cars not damaged because they enter a 
liability if they do not 
  Tenant interest 
  Tenants don t own their apartment, but they have interest to continue to use it: 
continued use 
  Tenants are responsible for returning property in reasonable condition (in order to 
get the security deposit), this is subjective 
  Bad tenants > bad landlords 
  Since tenants (especially college students) are uneducated about their 
rights and renting process, landlords will try to take advantage of their 
tenants - especially when it comes to security deposits 
Net Income Loss Exposure 
  Aka business interruption insurance 
  Typically not bought 
  A firm suffers a primary loss - as a result, firm suffers secondary  losses that 
creates indirect expenses 
  Net income loss exposure is not the 1st loss, it is the  bounce back  
  The normal process of a firm is interrupted 
  Decrease in revenues 
  Increase in expenses (expenses that would not occur if ___ didn t happen) 
  Impacts your bottom line (net income) 
Event Causing Net Income Losses 
  Damage to property owned by a firm 
  Delivery truck stolen (property loss, NOT net income loss) 
  Extra costs (net income losses): 
  Losing customers in general 
  Rent another truck causing increase in expenses 
  Orders not filled causing a decrease in revenue 


 
  Damage to property owned by others 
  Key supplier has a property loss 
  The firm is impacted by their supplier s loss and unable to produce goods 
causing a decrease in revenue 
  Ex: power/telephone company has a power outage for a storm 
  Pizza place: electric co says  no power for 5 days  
  Extra costs (net income loss) 
  Loss of revenue 
  Purchase of generator or dry ice to keep products from 
spoiling - extra expenses 
Personnel Loss Exposures 
  A firm has a key employee (CEO, CFO, top salesman) who suffers a person  al   loss 
(death, disability, illness) 
  Ex: a firm s top salesman gets cancer 
  The  person   specifically may suffer - loss of income, increase medical expenses, 
personal issue  
  This is why businesses give benefits 
  The  firm   may also suffer 
  Revenue decrease: sales down, decisions not made 
  Expenses increase: cost of replacing that person 
  Firms can buy insurance for this, called  key person  insurance 
  Personal issue from employees becomes a business issue 
 
TOPIC 3: LIABILITY LOSS EXPOSURES + ERM/TRM 
Lawsuits (arise from) 
  Bad behavior 
  Breaking a contract can lead to a lawsuit 
  Behavior is commonly classified as either: 
  Intentional (assault, libel, slander) 
  Libel and slander have increased recently because of social media 
  Unitionional (negligence or carelessness) - most common type 
Negligence and Legal Liability 
  Legal liability is established when: 
  There was negligence (jaywalking, speeding) 
  There was actual damage or loss 
What constitutes Negligence? 
  A failure of a person to exercise the proper degree of care 
  A jury decides what negligence is 
  The absolute burden is on the injured party 
  absolute/strict liability: doesn t try to figure out who s as fault, always employer 
  LL is established because accidents happen 
  Imposed whether anyone was at fault 


 
  Happens if children are involved - may not be able to read, also happens with 
workers compensation 
Measurement Issue 
  Usually easy to establish injury or damage occurred 
  Establishing the amount of damage is difficult 
  How much is someone s life worth 
Measurement of Losses 
  Property loss (PL) 
  Relatively simple to calculate 
  Get in a card accident and insurance co determines how much the car was 
worth/damages 
  Bodily Injury (BI) 
  Special damages 
  Compensate for measurable losses 
  Medical expenses 
  Loss of income (look at W2 to verify) 
  Easy to calculate - human behavior element makes it slightly 
subjective (some over exaggerate) 
  General damages 
  Compensate for intangible losses 
  Pain and suffering 
  Mental anguish 
  Difficult to estimate and measure 
  Similar to an inconvenience fee ($ for having to deal with something) 
  Ex: tennis player gets hit by driver that is texting, can t play tennis 
anymore - tennis player is compensated for not being able to play tennis 
anymore (very subjective) 
  Ex: elevator malfunction 
  $ is determined by who and how they react 
  Surgeon killed gets more $ than a janitor killed 
  Punitive damages 
  Amount assessed as a form of punishment 
  Gross   negligence is involved: company  knew   about error 
  Difficult to estimate and measure 
  Typically seen in product type data: because there are facts and research behind 
them 
Defense to Liability 
  Assumption of risk defense (by injured party) 
  One recognizes dangers involved in an activity 
  Voluntarily chooses to encounter it 
  Attending a hockey game 
  Going skydiving - you know you re getting into something risky 
  Loss must be inherent to actual activity 


 
  comparative/contributory negligence 
   You re not an innocent party  
  Plaintiff was partially to blame for what happens 
  Ex: two people fighting, 1st person throws a punch and misses and the 2nd 
person fights back. 1st person sustains losses but is not innocent because he 
instigated it 
Res Ipsa Loquitur (not strict liability) 
   The thing speaks for itself  
  Modification to law of negligence 
  Presumption of negligence on part of defendant 
  The fact of an injury sometimes enough 
  Often seen in medical area because there is limited expertise 
  Requirements: 
  Normally would not occur unless negligence 
  Defendant exclusively controls tool/equipment 
  Injured party does not contribute to loss 
  Dentists removes wrong tooth, surgeon operates on wrong ACL 
Vicarious Liability 
  One person becomes LL for the negligent behavior of another 
  Employers are held responsible for actions of their employees acting within the capacit y 
of employment 
  Employee must act on behalf of employer 
Joint and Several Liability 
  Negligence of two or more parties contribute to the injury or damage 
  Walking on campus construction site, machine hits you and you suffer damages - 
sue construction company and temple ( temple hired contractors) 
  Injured party may recover the entire amount of compensation from any negligent party 
who is able to pay - regardless of degree of that party s negligence 
   The search for the deep pockets  - sue the person with the most $ 
  Construction 90% responsible, TU only 10% - construction co says they will go 
out of business so TU takes the blame 
Product Liability 
  Manufacturers of a faulty product that injures someone or damages property may be 
held LL 
  negligence  
  Product is negligently made or improperly designed 
  Faulty coffee cup lid 
  Proper warning is not given to the consumer 
  Warning label of peanuts in product is not properly specified 
Product Liability Loss 
  Cost of defending and paying claims for injury 
  Cost of recalling and batched of products suspected of being defective 
  Damage to your names - bad publicity 


 
  Evolution of coffee cup is risk management 
Premises Liability (harm to people) 
  Owner or tenant may be held liable for damages if someone s injured 
  If the property of others is damaged as a result of a condition in or arising out of the 
premises 
  Trespasser - never kids 
  Someone comes without right and consensent - only obligated to abstain from 
doing intentional harm 
  Licensee (door hangers, law enforcement) 
  Comes onto property without knowledge of owner 
  No purpose of benefit to owner 
  Must  warn   of any hidden dangers 
  Social guest/invitee 
  Been invited for some purpose 
  From business perspective: customer in store 
  Must keep premises safe so no harm comes 
  Ex: party, kid gets hurt - kid sues everyone on the lease and co signers 
Animal Liability 
  Exotic animals - tiger, giant snake 
  Strict liability: owner is liable 
  Dogs 
  Some states have strict liability 
  Some states  one bite rule  - if dog has never bit before, could easily escape 
liability 
  Most insurance co won t cover you if you own a  dangerous breed  if dog does 
something 
  5 year old bit by neighbor's pit bull, sued and got lots of $ 
Traditional Risk Management 
  TRM 
  4 loss exposures (property, net income, personnel, liability) 
  Silo approach: individualized, departments 
  property/liability pure risk (hazard risks) - risk manager 
  Personnel risk - human resources 
  Operation risk - COO/business units 
  Financial risk - CFO 
  Strategic risk - CEO/Board of directors 
  Pure insurable risks 
Enterprise Risk Management 
  Manage risk and seize opportunity - proactive 
  Risk based approach to managing an enterprise 
  Very strategic, scientific approach 
  Breaks it down into quadrants 
  ERM does not ignore TRM 


 
  Quadrant #1: Hazard risks (TRM) 
  Fire, flood, lawsuits/liability 
  Generally pure 
  Quadrant #2: financial risks 
  Inflation, foreign exchange rates/currency, stock market, interest rates, volat ility, 
liquidity, credit, debt rating,   mostly speculative 
  How do these things impact how I finance things? 
  If I cant finance things how does that impact the future of my business? 
  Quadrant #3: operational risks (risks that arise out of business operations) -  mostly pure 
  Manufacturing products 
  Supply chain issue 
  service provider failures 
  system failures  
  product recall 
  Regulatory issues: (Commerce Bank example) 
  Employment practices/company policies and procedures 
  Discrimination - TRM would only worry about this 
  Turnover 
  Workplace violence/sexual assault - ERM worries about this 
  Quadrant #4: strategic of business risk (SWOT):  speculative in nature 
  Customer service issues (growing to be important because of social media) 
  Public relations (how you deal with certain things, topics, or issues) 
  Reputation 
  Competition 
  Bad business decisions (Blockbuster had the opportunity to buy Netflix and said 
no, they weren t worry about streaming, they were only worried about Walmart - 
BAD BUSINESS DECISION) 
  Amazon adapted and expanded horizons: very successful 
  Intellectual property 
  Ethics 
  Union issues 
ERM vs TRM 
  TRM is a silo approach: departmentalized approach 
  Focuses mainly on hazard risks (flood, fire) - handles by risk management area 
  Financial type risks are handled by CFO, finance or accounting 
  People tend to focus on what they manage, don t think about other 
departments or business in total (close minded approach) 
  Other risks are handled by their specific areas (departments) 
  Not much effort to make comparisons among various risks to understand 
cumulative impact on the firm 
  ERM is an integrated approach: occurs at enterprise level instead of individual 
departments 
  Risk management activities heavily impact business decisions 


 
  Designed to facilitate comparison and evaluation 
  Identify risks and determine if risks are correlated or independent 
  Certain departments (in TRM) may not know if they correlate 
  Risk maps 
  CRO 
  Change business strategy 
  Seize opportunity 
  CRO is critical
