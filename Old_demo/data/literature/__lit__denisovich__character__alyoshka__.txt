The prisoner Alyoshka is a Christ figure in the camp.
				He is incredibly resilient in the face of adversity, and reads every
				night from the half of the New Testament that he has copied into
				a notebook he keeps hidden by his bed. Forced by the prison camp
				to give up physical pleasures, Alyoshka relies instead on spiritual
				fulfillment. Shukhov, taking note of this Christ-like spirituality,
				realizes at the end of the novel that Alyoshka actually enjoys his
				life in the prison camp. Like a medieval monk whipping himself to
				focus on the goods of the spirit, Alyoshka finds pleasure in the
				pain of camp life.

Solzhenitsyn emphasizes the way that Alyoshkaâ€™s spirituality allows
				him to love his fellow man. Alyhoska is generous to his fellow prisoners,
				even though he has very little to offer them. Near the end of the
				novel, Shukhov notes that Alyoshka does favors for everyone in the
				camp and never expects anything in return. Shukhov is bewildered
				by this generosity, especially in a place where the struggle for
				survival separates people rather than binds them together. But Alyoshka
				is more concerned with feeding his soul than his body, and his eagerness
				to give of what little he has represents the triumph of the human
				spirit in oppressive conditions.
