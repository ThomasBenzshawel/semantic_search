On a cold December evening, Matthew enters the kitchen
					and realizes too late that Anne and her friends are already there
					conducting a rehearsal of “The Fairy Queen” in preparation for the
					Christmas concert. Shy of all the little girls, he stays silently
					in the corner until they leave. While observing the group, Matthew
					notices that Anne is dressed differently from her friends. He becomes
					convinced that she needs more fashionable clothing and goes into
					the town of Carmody to find a bright dress with puffed sleeves.
					Shopping is not an easy task for such a shy man, but Matthew summons
					his courage and goes to Samuel Lawson’s store, which he thinks will
					not have a female clerk at the desk. Much to Matthew’s dismay, he
					finds that Samuel Lawson has hired a female clerk, Miss Lucilla
					Harris.

	Matthew is too scared to ask Miss Harris for fashion
					advice, and asks for twenty pounds of brown sugar and a garden rake
					before making his escape. Matthew eventually asks Mrs. Rachel for
					help, and she picks out a rich brown fabric and uses a fashionable
					pattern to make Anne’s dress. Mrs. Rachel has often wondered why
					Marilla dresses Anne so plainly and is happy to have a part in updating Anne’s
					wardrobe. On Christmas Day, Matthew unveils the dress, complete
					with puffed sleeves. Diana comes over with a present from Aunt Josephine
					for Anne: delicate slippers. Anne is delighted by her beautiful
					new garments.

	Anne’s Christmas concert is the first one Matthew and
					Marilla have been to in twenty years. Anne, wearing her new dress
					and shoes, is the star of the show. Both Cuthberts are swollen with
					pride. Matthew immediately tells Anne how proud he is of her, but
					Marilla decides not to compliment Anne.

After the excitement of the Christmas concert, the Avonlea
					students return to their normal, humdrum patterns. Anne, now almost
					thirteen, vows to improve herself by imitating Mrs. Allan, refraining from
					saying uncharitable things and trying to do good.

	For school, the students are assigned to write a piece
					of fiction and a composition about a walk in the winter. These assignments displease
					Marilla because they rely on imagination rather than memorization.
					They elate Anne, however, and she completes her original story early.
					Diana moans that she does not have enough imagination to do the
					assignment. To help Diana cultivate her imagination and to practice
					her own writing, Anne proposes that the two girls start a story
					club. Two of their friends, Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis, eventually
					join, and the girls spend their time inventing romantic, melodramatic
					storylines.

One evening in late April, Marilla walks home feeling
					uplifted and lighthearted, though she does not realize that the
					sights of spring are the cause of her joy. She happily anticipates
					the warm fire and tea that Anne should have prepared for her at
					home. When she reaches Green Gables, Marilla finds the table bare
					and Anne nowhere to be found. She complains to Matthew that Anne
					has disobeyed her order to stay at home and prepare the meal. Her
					anger turns to concern when suppertime comes and there is still
					no sign of Anne. Marilla goes upstairs to get a candle from Anne’s
					room and finds her lying facedown on her bed, moaning that she is
					too ugly to be seen. It turns out that Anne has dyed her hair with
					disastrous results. She bought hair dye from a traveling peddler
					who claimed the dye would turn her hair raven black. The dye turned
					her hair green, and the only solution is for Marilla to crop it
					to an unfashionably short length. At first Anne weeps at the sight
					of herself in the mirror, but she then decides to look at her unattractive
					reflection to remind herself of the folly of vanity.

Anne, Diana, Ruby, and Jane enact a scene from a poem
					by Alfred Lord Tennyson in which the corpse of a character named
					Elaine is sent down a river in a barge. Though Anne does not look
					like Elaine, who has golden hair, she gets the part because none
					of the other girls want to drift down the pond alone in Mr. Barry’s
					little boat. The girls recite romantic farewells and send Anne’s
					unmoving body down the pond. For a few minutes, Anne revels in the
					romance of the situation, but she then feels water at her back.
					The boat has a leak, but Anne remains calm and prays for God to
					bring the boat close to one of the bridge piles (poles running vertically
					from the bridge to the bottom of the river) so she can grab on and
					wait for help. The girls see the boat sink, and, thinking that Anne
					has sunk with it, they run screaming for help. Anne is able to get
					to a bridge pile, however, where she hangs on and waits uncomfortably
					for help.

	Just when Anne begins to think she cannot hold on any
					longer, Gilbert Blythe rows up and rescues her. After depositing
					her safely on the bank, he makes a friendly overture, apologizing
					again for calling her “Carrots” when they first met and complimenting
					the auburn color her hair has become. For a moment, Anne hesitates and
					considers befriending her sworn enemy. But she then recalls her humiliation
					during the “Carrots” incident and declares she will never become
					friends with him. Gilbert storms off. Meanwhile, Diana and Jane
					cannot find any adults to help and have become frantic. Ruby, always
					inclined toward hysteria, grieves at the Barry house. When Diana
					and Jane return to the pond, they are relieved that Anne is safe
					and thrilled by the romance of her rescue by Gilbert. Anne, however,
					orders Jane never to say the word “romantic” again.

To some extent, Matthew and Marilla reverse the characteristics traditionally
					associated with men and women. Matthew goes to great trouble to
					get Anne a new, fashionable dress, exhibiting almost womanly qualities.
					Whereas Marilla thinks fashion silly, Matthew understands that Anne’s
					dowdy dresses probably embarrass her; he sees the importance of
					fitting into one’s peer group. Whereas Marilla is reserved and does
					not believe in spoiling children, exhibiting almost manly qualities,
					Matthew easily expresses his affection for Anne and welcomes every
					opportunity to dote on her.

Anne’s approach to writing, which she describes in Chapter 26, reflects
					Montgomery’s own approach. Anne writes romantic stories about ladies
					named Cordelia and Geraldine who fall in love and meet tragic ends.
					She explains to Marilla that the stories all have morals: the good
					people are rewarded and the bad people are punished. Similarly,
					Montgomery makes moral judgments about Anne’s behavior. Montgomery
					does not divide the world into good and bad people, but she does
					reward Anne’s strengths and punish her faults. Anne’s mistakes never
					result in tragedy, but she meets with difficulties that are tragic
					in her perspective.

At the end of Chapter 28, Anne
					reflects on all of her mistakes. She realizes that each mistake
					has taught her an important lesson and that, taken together, the
					mistakes and lessons have made her a better person. After taking
					Marilla’s brooch, for example, she learns not to play with things
					that don’t belong to her. After running panicked through the woods,
					she learns to keep her imagination in check. After making cake with
					liniment, she learns to take care while cooking. After dyeing her
					hair, she learns to curb her vanity. Anne’s faults and quirky traits,
					which Marilla and Mrs. Rachel enumerate at the beginning of Anne’s
					stay, disappear with every mistake, chapter by chapter.

Although Anne’s desire to rid herself of faults shows
					her maturation, she has not yet perfected herself. For example,
					she resolves to be modest after her vanity results in green hair,
					but her vanity over her hair makes her simmer afresh over a years-old
					insult and causes her to reject Gilbert’s offer of friendship. Gilbert’s
					rescue teaches Anne yet another lesson that demonstrates that she
					still has room to mature: real-life romance does not yet suit her.
					Although the boat episode has all the markings of the kind of fictional
					romance Anne loves—danger, a woman in distress, a last-minute rescue
					by a handsome man—Anne finds the event awkward, embarrassing, and
					irritating rather than charming and romantic.
