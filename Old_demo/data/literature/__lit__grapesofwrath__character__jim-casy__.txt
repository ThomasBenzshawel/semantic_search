Steinbeck employs Jim Casy to articulate some of the novel’s
				major themes. Most notably, the ex-preacher redefines the concept
				of holiness, suggesting that the most divine aspect of human experience
				is to be found on earth, among one’s fellow humans, rather than
				amid the clouds. As a radical philosopher, a motivator and unifier
				of men, and a martyr, Casy assumes a role akin to that of Jesus
				Christ—with whom he also shares his initials. Casy begins the novel
				uncertain of how to use his talents as a speaker and spiritual healer
				if not as the leader of a religious congregation. By the end of
				the novel, he has learned to apply them to his task of organizing
				the migrant workers. Indeed, Casy comes to believe so strongly in
				his mission to save the suffering laborers that he willingly gives
				his life for it. Casy’s teachings prompt the novel’s most dramatic
				character development, by catalyzing Tom Joad’s transformation into
				a social activist and man of the people.
