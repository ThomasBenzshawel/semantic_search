A greedy and ruthless man, Danglars cares only for his
				personal fortune. He has no qualms about sacrificing others for
				the sake of his own welfare, and he goes through life shrewdly calculating
				ways to turn other people’s misfortunes to his own advantage.
				Danglars’s betrayal of Dantès starts him on the path to utter disregard
				for other people’s lives, but this betrayal is not the cruelest
				of his acts. Danglars abandons his wife and attempts to sell his
				own daughter, Eugénie, into a loveless and miserable marriage for
				three million francs.

Though he manages to claw his way into a position of great wealth
				and power, Danglars’s greed grows as he grows richer, and his lust
				for money continues to drive all his actions in the two decades
				that the novel spans. Even when faced with the prospect of starvation,
				Danglars prefers to keep his fortune rather than pay an exorbitant
				price for food. Finally, Danglars relents in his pathological avarice,
				allowing that he would give all his remaining money just to remain
				alive. Only after Danglars repents for the evil he has done does
				Dantès consider Danglars redeemed and pardon him.
