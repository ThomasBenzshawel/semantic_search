The unseen, unknown inspiration for all of Don Quixote’s
				exploits, Dulcinea, we are told, is a simple peasant woman who has
				no knowledge of the valorous deeds that Don Quixote commits in her name.
				We never meet Dulcinea in the novel, and on the two occasions when
				it seems she might appear, some trickery keeps her away from the
				action. In the first case, the priest intercepts Sancho, who is on
				his way to deliver a letter to Dulcinea from Don Quixote. In the second
				instance, Sancho says that Dulcinea has been enchanted and that
				he thus cannot locate her.

Despite her absence from the novel, Dulcinea is an important force
				because she epitomizes Don Quixote’s chivalric conception of the
				perfect woman. In his mind, she is beautiful and virtuous, and she
				makes up for her lack of background and lineage with her good deeds.
				Don Quixote describes her chiefly in poetic terms that do little
				to specify her qualities. She is, therefore, important not for who she
				is but for what her character represents and for what she indicates
				about Don Quixote’s character.
