The curate, or minister, represents the weak-willed members of humanity who do not rely on reason. Wells does not specifically describe the curate’s standing as a clergyman, but he often rambles on about God and thinks that the invasion is due to humanity’s unspecified sins. The curate feels that he has made a poor showing as God’s representative. He is motivated to understand what is happening, but because he is afraid to be alone, he follows the Narrator unbidden. His defiance of the Narrator’s reasonable requests that will contribute to their joint survival illustrates that the curate has lost what is left of his senses. He shows no reason or forethought, traits that Wells exemplifies throughout the book as important attributes. The curate’s senselessness will ultimately be his undoing, and his faith does not save him.
