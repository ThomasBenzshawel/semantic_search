In a sense, Moby Dick is not a character, as the reader
				has no access to the White Whale’s thoughts, feelings, or intentions.
				Instead, Moby Dick is an impersonal force, one that many critics
				have interpreted as an allegorical representation of God, an inscrutable
				and all-powerful being that humankind can neither understand nor defy.
				Moby Dick thwarts free will and cannot be defeated, only accommodated
				or avoided. Ishmael tries a plethora of approaches to describe whales
				in general, but none proves adequate. Indeed, as Ishmael points
				out, the majority of a whale is hidden from view at all times. In
				this way, a whale mirrors its environment. Like the whale, only
				the surface of the ocean is available for human observation and interpretation,
				while its depths conceal unknown and unknowable truths. Furthermore,
				even when Ishmael does get his hands on a “whole” whale, he is unable
				to determine which part—the skeleton, the head, the skin—offers
				the best understanding of the whole living, breathing creature;
				he cannot localize the essence of the whale. This conundrum can
				be read as a metaphor for the human relationship with the Christian
				God (or any other god, for that matter): God is unknowable and cannot
				be pinned down.
