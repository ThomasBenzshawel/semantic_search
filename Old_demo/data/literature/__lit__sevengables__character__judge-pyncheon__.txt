Judge Pyncheon is the novel’s most visible antagonist.
				An antagonist is a character or impediment that opposes the protagonist
				and creates conflict in a literary work. Judge Pyncheon provides
				a living example of the cruelty and ambition that have brought the
				Pyncheon family such misfortune. His most noteworthy feature is
				his deceiving smile, which is so alluring that it almost has a personality of
				its own. Despite his welcoming countenance, the Judge’s true nature
				is overwhelmingly greedy. The Judge appears to agree with the popular
				perception that he is innocent and righteous, but these perceptions
				differ sharply from what Hawthorne suggests to us. The Judge’s ties
				to the dubious Pyncheon past are unmistakable, most clearly revealed
				by his resemblance to Colonel Pyncheon’s portrait and by his death
				from apoplexy, a sudden hemorrhage, which killed both the Colonel
				and the Judge’s Uncle Jaffrey. In the public’s perception, the Judge
				is a model of austerity and morality, and Hawthorne devotes much
				of the novel to unveiling the dark truths that such popular perceptions
				hide. Only the truly good characters—such as Phoebe, Clifford, and
				Hepzibah—recognize that the Judge’s alluring smile hides a cruel
				soul. The Judge’s death seems to put an end to the Pyncheon legacy
				of misfortune.
