Thrust into the world of the Glade with no memories, Thomas enters the story feeling shocked, disoriented, scared, and alone. However, his curiosity proves to be a useful and powerful tool. Thomas is driven by his quest for knowledge about his new environment, and he is resentful of how his lack of knowledge marks him as an outsider. While he tries to put on a show of being content with being alone, Thomas quickly comes to depend on his friendship with Chuck. In this world of found family, Thomas comes to look out for Chuck as if the boy were a little brother. It is through his relationship with Chuck that Thomas comes to understand the importance of friendship in the formidable world of the Glade. 

Though Thomas is inherently brave, he also shows a penchant for impulsivity and a lack of reverence for the hierarchy and order that are crucial for survival in the Glade. In his decision to dash through the Doors to save Alby and Minho, he not only breaks the Glade’s number one rule and illustrates his willingness to flout authority, but he also puts his own life in jeopardy. As a newbie, his deep desire to become a Runner also makes him appear foolhardy, rash, and ridiculous. The change and chaos that follow close on the heels of his arrival further cast him in a distrustful light. At points, without solid memories or understanding of who he is, Thomas wonders if he can even trust himself. Because of the care and loyalty he displays, as well as his willingness to be truthful about his memories during the Changing, he eventually earns the trust of most of the Gladers. Thomas’s behavior in the present outshines his vague memories of a somewhat questionable past. Throughout the novel, even in the face of life-or-death challenges, Thomas exhibits intelligence, strong problem-solving skills, and a desire to fight for his own survival and that of those around him. Through his actions, Thomas proves himself to be trustworthy, reliable, and resourceful.
