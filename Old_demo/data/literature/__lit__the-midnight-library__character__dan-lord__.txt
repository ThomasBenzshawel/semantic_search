Dan Lord, Nora’s ex-fiancé in her root life, serves as one of the antagonists of the book. Though he professes to love Nora, he often seems to resent her successes and even her happiness. As his name suggests, Dan lords over Nora, often criticizing her, subtly undermining her, resenting her intelligence, and insulting her dreams. In their root life together, Dan discouraged Nora from following her passion for music, and in their pub life together, he pettily resents the fact that she knows more than he does. Despite all of his negative traits, Nora blames herself for the dissolution of the would-be marriage, and the bulk of her regrets before finding the Midnight Library concerned her act of leaving Dan. The alternate pub life teaches Nora that she overlooked or ignored his major red flags, and she is able to let go of the burden of those regrets. Later, when she visits her rockstar life, Dan is Nora’s stalker, which suggests that every version of their life together leads to heartache and disappointment.
