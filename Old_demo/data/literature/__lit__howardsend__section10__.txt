					After his indiscretion with Helen, Leonard is
					consumed with a pitiless remorse that eats away at
					him.  Seeing Margaret and Tibby in a
					cathedral one day, he resolves to confess his misdeed
					to Margaret, hoping to ease his
					conscience.  However, he knows nothing of
					Margaret--not even that she is married to Henry Wilcox--and
					it takes him some time to discover her whereabouts.
					He learns that she and Henry have gone to Howards
					End; it is the very same day that Helen's pregnancy
					is discovered, when Henry and Margaret have their
					terrible fight.
				


					The next day, Leonard takes a train to Hilton and
					walks to Howards End.  On the way, he lapses into a
					kind of daze, in which his extreme sorrow seems to
					transform the squalor of his life into tragedy.  His
					grief seems to awaken something great in him.  In the
					meantime, Charles has gone to Howards End to
					force Margaret and Helen to leave.  When Leonard
					arrives, he enters the house; Charles sees him, and,
					echoing his father's desire to "thrash him within an
					inch of his life," seizes the Schlegels' great German
					sword, and begins to beat Leonard with the flat of
					the blade.  Leonard stumbles backward into the
					bookcase, which falls on him, covering him with
					books.  Leonard experiences heart failure and dies.
					Charles leaves, stopping at the police station to
					tell them that Leonard had a heart attack.  The
					police tell him that there will have to be an
					inquest.
				


					Margaret answers the policemen's questions, saying
					that Charles' actions could not have caused Leonard's
					death, though they may have hastened it.  She
					decides to go to Germany with Helen, and she tells
					Henry this; Henry shocks her by telling her that the
					police have found that manslaughter was the cause of
					death.  Charles will spend three years in prison.
					Henry is shattered.  On the verge of a nervous
					breakdown, he asks Margaret to take care of him.
				


					Fourteen months later, Margaret, Henry, Helen, and
					Helen's child are all living happily at Howards End.
					Henry and Helen have learned to like one another, and
					are now good friends; Helen's little boy plays
					happily with the village children.  London is barely
					visible on the horizon.  Henry is exhausted, and
					still frail from his sudden confrontation with his
					inner weakness; he is not his old self.  He calls all
					his children to Howards End--Dolly comes in
					Charles' place--to tell them that he is leaving the
					house to Margaret, in return for which she will
					receive no money when he dies.  The children all
					accept the dictate, though Paul, now returned
					from Nigeria to run his father's business, is
					scornful.  As they leave, Dolly comments that it is
					odd that Mrs. Wilcox wanted Margaret to have
					Howards End, and now she will after all.
				


					When they are alone, Margaret asks Henry about
					Dolly's comment, and he reveals to her that his wife
					wished to leave her Howards End.  She tells him that
					he did no wrong to keep it from her.  Helen runs into
					the room with the baby, announcing happily that the
					meadow has been cut, and there will be "such a crop
					of hay as never!"
				


					The novel's conclusion is heavy with symbolism, but
					the symbolism is fairly simple compared to the
					nuanced ambiguities of the rest of the novel.
					Leonard's death comes when he topples a bookcase
					on top of himself, symbolizing his terrible obsession
					with educating himself and his failure to pull
					himself from "the abyss" (of poverty) with books--in
					a way, books ruin him as a human being before they
					smother him and cause his heart attack.  Charles'
					surprising conviction for manslaughter indicates the
					eroding authority of the upper classes:  no matter
					how conventional and "solid" he acts, he cannot kill
					a man with impunity and get away with it.
				


					The final scene at Howards End provides a happy
					ending for the novel, with Helen and Henry
					becoming friends at last, and Henry's hypocritical
					edifice being replaced with a more genuine human
					presence.  This final chapter also directly addresses
					the question of "Who will inherit England?" by
					featuring Henry's decision about who will inherit
					Howards End itself.  Margaret will inherit
					Howards End, and she intends to leave it to Helen's
					child.  In other words, Howards End will fall from
					the materialistic upper class to the idealistic upper
					class, and thence to an offspring of the upper and
					lower classes.  In a sense, the final living
					arrangement at Howards End indicates Forster's belief
					that, if people could "only connect," there would be
					a place for every class at Howards End, and in
					England.  The classes are becoming irrevocably
					mixed; London is encroaching on the countryside, and
					World War I is looming in the near future
					(unbeknownst to Forster at the time he wrote the
					novel, though even in 1910 he was certainly fearful
					of a conflict between England and Germany).  But for
					the time, all is well; the classes can live together
					happily, and the future of England seems less
					uncertain, and less dim.
