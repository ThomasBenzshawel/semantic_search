Esther, Charley, and Mr. Jarndyce go to Lincolnshire to
					stay at Mr. Boythorn’s house. Esther cares for Mr. Boythorn’s bird
					while she’s there. When she’s alone, she looks in a mirror for the
					first time and sees her scarred face, barely recognizing herself.
					She believes her beauty has entirely disappeared. Esther confesses
					that she has secretly kept Mr. Woodcourt’s flowers. She decides
					to keep them still, to remind herself of her former beauty.

Esther and Charley stay outdoors all day, to help restore
					Esther’s health. They ride horses through town and stop to rest
					at Esther’s favorite place in the woods. Though Chesney Wold is
					very close, Esther says she never ventured close to it, for no good
					reason. One day, Esther spots Lady Dedlock approaching in the woods.
					Lady Dedlock approaches her and inquires about her health. Esther
					is shocked to see Lady Dedlock holding her handkerchief, the one she’d
					given to Jenny. Instantly understanding, Esther sends Charley away,
					and Lady Dedlock cries and says she is Esther’s mother.

Lady Dedlock begs for Esther’s forgiveness and says that
					she must continue to keep this secret for Sir Leicester’s sake.
					Lady Dedlock is overcome with grief and guilt but says they can
					never communicate again. Esther asks if the secret is safe, and
					Lady Dedlock says that Tulkinghorn may reveal it soon. She tells
					Esther to confide in Mr. Jarndyce if she wishes. Esther tells us
					that Lady Dedlock gives her a letter but says that she’ll tell us
					the contents of the letter another time.

Ada arrives at Lincolnshire and has no negative reaction
					to Esther’s changed appearance.

Esther tells no one about Lady Dedlock. One day, Mr. Grubble,
					the landlord of the public house Dedlock Arms, summons Esther. When she
					arrives, she finds Richard there. He is on leave and has come to check
					up on his interests in the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit. Mr. Skimpole
					is with him and is glad Richard’s involved with the suit. Esther
					brings Richard to Ada, but she suspects Richard doesn’t love her
					as he says he does.

The next day, Richard tells Esther more about his pursuit
					of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. He says he and Mr. Jarndyce have parted ways
					and that the suit is his one goal now. Ada writes Richard a letter
					trying to dissuade him, but to no avail. Esther tries to convince Mr.
					Skimpole not to support Richard’s goal, since it’s irresponsible, but
					Mr. Skimpole says he can’t possibly be responsible. Later, when Richard
					goes off to meet someone, Mr. Skimpole says he is going to meet
					Mr. Vholes, his legal advisor. Skimpole admits that Vholes paid
					him to be introduced to Richard.

Richard returns with Vholes and introduces him to everyone. Vholes
					says he does everything for the sake of his three daughters and
					his aging father. He and Richard depart so that Richard can attend
					to the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case the next day. Ada tells Esther
					that she’ll love Richard even if the lawsuit ruins him.

Esther returns to Bleak House in full health and visits
					London on the pretense of visiting Caddy. Caddy and Prince Turveydrop
					live with Mr. Turveydrop, and Mr. Jellyby visits every evening.
					Caddy is practicing to be a dancing instructor. There are also several
					children in the house who are learning to dance. Esther attends
					one of the dance practices.

Afterward, Esther and Caddy go to see Mr. Guppy, and Esther speaks
					to him alone. Mr. Guppy is intent on reminding Esther that she refused
					his proposal and that he will not renew it. Esther agrees readily
					that the proposal is now defunct. Esther then reminds him that when
					he made the proposal, he suggested that he could find out information
					about her background. Esther asks him to cease all investigation
					if he hasn’t already, and Mr. Guppy agrees to honor her wish.

The narrator describes Mr. Vholes and his small, dark
					office in Symond’s Inn. Mr. Vholes claims to be a respectable man,
					fully devoted to his clients and their affairs. Mr. Vholes wholeheartedly promotes
					the idea that the backbone of English law is that it must make business
					for itself. Yet he convinces Richard that they will make progress
					in the suit. Richard trusts him completely.

Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle see Richard on the street, and
					Mr. Guppy observes that Richard is now in debt because he wouldn’t stay
					away from the suit. Mr. Guppy then tells Mr. Weevle that he no longer
					wishes to find the letters from the now dead Krook. He asks Mr.
					Weevle to tell him if there’s any chance the letters didn’t burn and
					might be hidden in Krook’s shop.

Grandfather Smallweed has been coming to the shop every
					day, searching through Krook’s belongings, but he never finds anything of
					value. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle go to the shop, chat briefly with Grandfather
					Smallweed, then go upstairs to Mr. Weevle’s old lodging. Mr. Tulkinghorn
					appears. He congratulates Guppy on being able to meet with grand
					ladies. Guppy grows red and tells Tulkinghorn that he doesn’t have
					to explain himself. Tulkinghorn leaves. Guppy admits to Weevle that
					he’s been in communication with a member of the aristocracy, but
					that this must end and be forgotten.

The narrator discusses the state of England, which is
					in disarray. Mrs. Rouncewell suspects that the family may be needed,
					and she prepares Chesney Wold accordingly. But the house seems dismal.
					A groom tells Mrs. Rouncewell that Lady Dedlock is not well. She
					and Sir Leicester and a large group of people go to Chesney Wold
					the next day; people come and go from the house constantly for the
					next several weeks. Each day, Volumnia asks Sir Leicester how the
					country is doing, and Sir Leicester says “tolerably” and that people
					are opposed to the government. He says that the party has incurred great
					expenses.

Volumnia observes that Tulkinghorn must be very busy,
					but Sir Leicester says he doesn’t know of Tulkinghorn’s helping
					any clients. A servant named Mercury says that Tulkinghorn has arrived
					at Chesney Wold. He appears in the room and tells Sir Leicester
					that he has lost the election. Tulkinghorn says that Mr. Rouncewell
					was involved in this election and was running against Sir Leicester,
					aided by his son, who is in love with Rosa. Sir Leicester is enraged.
					He suggests that Lady Dedlock advise Rosa to stay away from the
					boy. Tulkinghorn says that the boy will likely leave Rosa instead,
					since the family has too much pride.

Tulkinghorn then tells a story: He has learned that a
					man of similar social standing from the same town as Mr. Rouncewell
					had a daughter that was favored by an aristocratic woman. This woman had
					a secret: she had once been engaged to a captain and had an illegitimate
					child. The captain died, but the woman’s secret was discovered because
					she made an impudent mistake. Her husband was devastated, and the
					townsman forbade his daughter from spending any more time with the
					woman. He took his daughter away.

Throughout this tale, Lady Dedlock has sat very still.
					Tulkinghorn asks her forgiveness for the painfulness of the story.

When Esther looks at herself in the mirror and sees her
					scarred face for the first time, she reveals her vulnerability more
					than at any other point in the novel. Never one to indulge in self-pity,
					she plainly observes that even though she had never been beautiful,
					what little beauty she had is now gone completely. The simplicity
					of her statement—“It was all gone now”—is characteristic of Esther’s
					clear, direct narrative style, but it also reveals how deeply she
					feels the loss. No matter how fond others are of her, no amount
					of affection, love, or respect can alter the fact that her face
					has been ruined. Although she goes on once again to count her blessings
					and get over her sadness determinedly, this plain statement suggests
					that there is great pain beneath Esther’s relentless cheerfulness.
					Her decision to keep Mr. Woodcourt’s flowers also suggests the depth
					of her sadness. Although she claims to be fully content with her
					lot in life, she keeps the flowers to remind her of how she used
					to look. She may go on with her life uncomplainingly, but she does
					not go on without a secret reserve of regret.

The revelatory confrontation between Lady Dedlock and
					Esther brings a secret to the surface, but their brief encounter
					focuses on the necessity of protecting that secret still further.
					Esther divines Lady Dedlock’s secret as soon as she sees the handkerchief
					and, like Lady Dedlock, is overcome with violent emotion. Their
					happiness at finding each other is brief, and the overarching tone
					of this encounter is fearful. Esther is unsettled to see Lady Dedlock
					at her feet, asking her forgiveness. Lady Dedlock is newly consumed
					by her own guilt, referring to the “dark road” she must follow and
					declaring herself to be “wretched and dishonoring.” Lady Dedlock’s
					fear of being discovered overshadows any happiness or relief she
					may feel at finally revealing her secret. She has just connected
					with the daughter she thought was dead, and yet she asserts that
					they can never meet or talk again. She is almost looking over her
					shoulder as they speak, and she and Esther conspire about who suspects
					their relationship. Both vow to keep the secret at all costs, and
					while they can’t pursue a public relationship, this secret binds
					them together.

The narrator’s scathing portrayal of Mr. Vholes in chapter 38 indicts
					the legal system as a self-perpetuating waste and lawyers as cannibals.
					The narrator draws an analogy that directly connects Vholes and
					his family to “cannibal chiefs” and says, “Make man-eating un-lawful,
					and you starve the Vholeses!” The endless Jarndyce and Jarndyce
					lawsuit is a dream job for Vholes, since the case will never end
					and Vholes can extract money from Richard indefinitely. The narrator
					is not subtle in his descriptions, leaving no question that Vholes
					is immoral, untrustworthy, and dangerous. These views are underscored
					by the narrator’s repetition of the statement, “Mr. Vholes is a
					very respectable man.” The more we know about Vholes, the more sarcastic
					this statement becomes. Because of men like Vholes, the legal system
					has ceased to serve the people and instead serves only the scheming
					lawyers who want to make themselves rich.
