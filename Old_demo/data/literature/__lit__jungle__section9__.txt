Jurgis begins begging for a job. Unfortunately, the strike
					ends just as he is at his most desperate. The labor imported during
					the strike adds more men to the crowds searching for work. Moreover,
					his standard of living increased exponentially when money came easily to
					him, so the return to homeless begging hits him hard. He eventually
					obtains a job only to be fired because he is not strong enough for
					the work. Winter approaches, and election time arrives again. Jurgis watches
					bitterly as the graft continues while he can no longer take part in
					it. He attends a political meeting where he can stay warm, but a policeman
					throws him out after he falls asleep and begins to snore.

While begging for the price of a night’s lodging, Jurgis
					encounters a woman he knew from his first years in Packingtown.
					She is well-dressed now. She does not have any money with her, but
					she gives him Marija’s address. She urges Jurgis to visit Marija and
					Teta Elzbieta. She assures him that they will be happy to see him.
					Jurgis hurries to see Marija. When he enters the building, the police
					raid the establishment. Jurgis realizes that it is a brothel.

Jurgis spots Marija, and they manage to talk a bit before
					the police herd them into the police station. Marija explains that
					neither she nor Teta Elzbieta could support the children with legitimate jobs.
					She adds that, moreover, Stanislovas died: he fell asleep in the storeroom
					of an oil factory and a swarm of rats attacked him and killed him.
					Marija then chose to go into prostitution in order to keep the rest
					of the family from starvation. She assures Jurgis that they never
					blamed him for running away and that they know that he did his best.
					The knowledge of Marija’s shame and Stanislovas’s horrible death
					haunts Jurgis throughout the night, which he spends in jail.

The madam of the brothel pays Marija’s fine and the prostitutes
					are set free. The judge lets Jurgis go without penalty because Jurgis
					says that he had gone merely to visit his sister. He gives a false
					name at his arrest, and no one recognizes him as Phil Connor’s attacker.
					Marija later confesses that she is a morphine addict. Most of the
					prostitutes, she tells Jurgis, are addicted to something. She explains
					that women are kidnapped and forced into the work and that they
					cannot leave because the madam keeps them in debt and addicted to
					drugs. Marija gives Jurgis Teta Elzbieta’s address and urges him
					to stay with her and her remaining children. Jurgis doesn’t want
					to see her until he gets a job because he feels guilty for leaving
					them after Antanas died.

Jurgis spends the rest of the day looking for
					work. He eats dinner and, while walking the streets, chances upon
					a political meeting. He enters the hall to sit and rest while he
					ponders how Teta Elzbieta will receive him. He fears her condemnation
					and the possibility that she may think that he merely wants to loaf
					at her expense. He begins to nod off during the speech. A well-dressed woman
					calls him “comrade” and urges him to listen to the speech. No one
					tries to throw him out for sleeping.

Jurgis listens to the speech; he has wandered
					into a socialist political meeting. The speaker details the miserable
					conditions of life for the common worker. He points out the corrupt
					practices of big capitalists to grind common laborers into submission.
					Jurgis finds the expression of all of his misery in the man’s speech.
					He enters an exultation of joy listening to the rousing words of
					the speaker. He finds confirmation of everything that he has suffered
					and everything that he has seen. For the first time, he has found
					a political party to represent his interests rather than those of
					the privileged, powerful, and wealthy.

Marija’s entrance into prostitution culminates the essential
					accusation that Sinclair levels against capitalism: throughout The
						Jungle, he charges capitalism with trafficking in human
					lives. Human beings are despicably regarded as useful resources—means
					to an end rather than individuals—and are used until they are worn
					out and then ultimately thrown away. As a prostitute, Marija epitomizes
					this trafficking in human bodies, as society’s perception of her worth
					lies wholly in her ability to satisfy the basest desires of humankind.
					Just as the prostitutes are kept in a form of slavery, Sinclair
					often compares wage laborers to slaves, another form of trafficking
					in human bodies. Throughout the novel, human lives are bought and
					sold, although most wage laborers don’t even realize that they are
					part of a vast market of human flesh.

To this point, the meaning of the title The Jungle has
					been made painfully clear: the world of the wage laborer is a savage
					realm characterized by a Darwinian struggle for survival. Those
					who refuse to sacrifice their humanity, integrity, and individuality
					do not survive, much less succeed, in this world. New arrivals enter
					into this jungle crammed with predators waiting to attack them at
					every turn. The structures of capitalism are a jungle of hidden
					nooks and crannies, each containing yet another dirty secret. Sinclair’s
					novel exposes the various levels of deception within the factories
					as well as the day-to-day details of the wage laborer’s life. He
					probes the courtroom, prison, and criminal underworld in order to
					show the far reach of capitalism’s structures of power.

Having gone to such great lengths to illustrate the evils
					of capitalism, Sinclair now offers socialism as the solution to
					the problems that the first twenty-seven chapters of the novel have
					explored in detail. When Jurgis enters the socialist political meeting
					in Chapter 28, he is a defeated man: he has
					tried all forms of survival but none has offered the security
					and the peace of mind that he seeks. The socialist political meeting,
					however, proves anything but a jungle; rather, it is a haven from
					the cruel reality of capitalism. The rude awakening at the hands
					of an unsympathetic policeman is replaced by the gentle nudge of
					one who wants him to better himself by understanding the socialist message.
					That this woman addresses him as “comrade” demonstrates her desire
					for them to be equal, which shocks Jurgis; that she is beautiful
					and well-dressed pits her against all of the wealthy capitalists
					who ignore the suffering of the common laborer.

As the speaker catalogues the abuses and suffering of
					wage laborers, Jurgis reacts to socialism like a new, devout religious
					convert. Unlike the preacher at the religious revival meeting, who
					wanted commoners to better themselves according to the existing
					system, the socialist speaker wants commoners to motivate for change outside the
					system. He understands Jurgis’s experiences and addresses Jurgis’s
					needs rather than those of the wealthy. For the first time in America,
					Jurgis feels that he is no longer alone; just as he earlier gives
					himself to the quasi-religious pursuit of the American Dream, he
					is now willing to give himself to this camaraderie.
