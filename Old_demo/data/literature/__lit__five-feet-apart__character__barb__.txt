Barb has known Stella since Stella was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and feels extremely protective of her. Barb comforts Stella when she feels upset, tries to keep Will away from Stella, and scolds Stella’s parents for not being there when their daughter needs them. Although Barb is the foil to Stella and Will’s romance, she acts out of love and concern, filling the gap left by Stella’s parents. Barb feels adamant about keeping Stella and Will apart due to her own history when she let two patients with cystic fibrosis be together. She is determined to never let such a tragedy happen again. In many ways, Barb is the parental figure that Stella does not have in her own parents.
