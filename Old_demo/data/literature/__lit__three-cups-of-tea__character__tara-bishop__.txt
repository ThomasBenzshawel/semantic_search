Although Tara Bishop does not appear extensively in the book, she acts as a
				crucial helpmate and anchor for Mortenson. In fact, Tara, who was brought up among
				explorers, seems almost uniquely suited to be Mortenson’s wife. Most importantly,
				she accepts Mortenson’s impetuous personality and erratic work schedule and
				maintains a home life that enables Mortenson to have some balance between work and
				family. Although she worries about Mortenson’s safety and lives in what she calls
				“functional denial” while he is away, she nonetheless never wavers in her support
				for his work. She even takes their two children on trips to Pakistan when she can.
				Tara does also recognize Mortenson’s flaws, and she encourages and helps him to make
				necessary personal changes, such as paying better attention to schedules.
