Hedda Gabler, a play by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, was first published in 1890. The play is a character study of the title character, a woman trapped in a loveless marriage who seeks to control and manipulate those around her. Ibsen's exploration of Hedda’s inner turmoil and the consequences of societal expectations makes Hedda Gabler a compelling psychological drama, highlighting the limitations placed on women in 19th-century bourgeois society. The play has been adapted for film and television numerous times, including a 1963 television production of the play starring Ingrid Bergman.
