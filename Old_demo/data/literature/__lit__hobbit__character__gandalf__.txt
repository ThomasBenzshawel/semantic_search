Though his history and character are more fully explored
				in The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, Gandalf
				remains a looming mystery in The Hobbit, a constant
				reminder that Middle-Earth is more vast and cryptic than Bilbo realizes.
				A powerful wizard, Gandalf generally prefers to keep his powers
				and motives closely guarded. He never reveals, for instance, why
				he chooses to help Thorin in his quest; he certainly has no interest
				in the treasure, and he leaves the company in Mirkwood while he
				goes to fight against the Necromancer. Something both inspiring
				and dangerous defines Gandalf’s character—he is an unshakable bulwark
				against evil, and yet he seems to have an enlightened, almost godlike
				knowledge of every person’s place in the world. 

Gandalf’s sweeping, epic personality separates him from
				the vast majority of characters that commercial fantasy literature
				has produced in the decades since The Hobbit was
				first published. Though Gandalf can be viewed as the source of the
				stereotypical figure of fantasy wizard, Gandalf himself is more
				than just an old man with powerful spells and a pointy hat. Tolkien
				imbues Gandalf with a sense of heightened awareness, ensuring that
				Gandalf always knows more about what is happening than we do, even
				when the other characters are left in the dark.
