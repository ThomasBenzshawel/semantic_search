Fletcher is not a particularly deep character. He fills a somewhat typical role as an adversary and villain in this book. The situation with him escalates slowly throughout the book, giving a sense of credibility at the end when the only resolution and finality is achieved through death. Fletcher is a foil for both Joe and Shane, and he represents what many people misleading believe is a true man. Eventually, good and truth triumph over evil, and Fletcher is beaten once and for all.
