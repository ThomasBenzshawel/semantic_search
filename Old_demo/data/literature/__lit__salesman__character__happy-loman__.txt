Happy shares none of the poetry that erupts from Biff
				and that is buried in Willy—he is the stunted incarnation of Willy’s
				worst traits and the embodiment of the lie of the happy American
				Dream. As such, Happy is a difficult character with whom to empathize.
				He is one-dimensional and static throughout the play. His empty
				vow to avenge Willy’s death by finally “beat[ing] this racket” provides
				evidence of his critical condition: for Happy, who has lived in
				the shadow of the inflated expectations of his brother, there is
				no escape from the Dream’s indoctrinated lies. Happy’s diseased
				condition is irreparable—he lacks even the tiniest spark of self-knowledge
				or capacity for self-analysis. He does share Willy’s
				capacity for self-delusion, trumpeting himself as the assistant
				buyer at his store, when, in reality, he is only an assistant to
				the assistant buyer. He does not possess a hint of the latent thirst
				for knowledge that proves Biff’s salvation. Happy is a doomed, utterly
				duped figure, destined to be swallowed up by the force of blind
				ambition that fuels his insatiable sex drive.
