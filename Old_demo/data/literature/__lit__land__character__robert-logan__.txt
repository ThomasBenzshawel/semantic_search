Paul's brother and childhood companion, Robert, is even-tempered, gentle, and timorous. He is afraid of horses and does not have a natural way with land and animals, but he is bright and sweet-tempered. In the early parts of the novel, Paul stands up for Robert. Robert expresses great distress when their father sends the two boys to different schools, and he expresses his wish that the two were full brothers. As Robert grows into adolescence, however, and spends the majority of his time with his peers at boarding school, Robert's sweet, unbiased worldview begins to unravel. He becomes ashamed and angry when Paul speaks to him as an equal in front of his white friends, and he betrays Paul to their father. Robert is troubled by this betrayal but retains his growing conviction that he is entitled to greater respect and authority than Paul. Robert appears in Paul's adult life only once, and though the two talk congenially, they never regain the bond they once held as children.
