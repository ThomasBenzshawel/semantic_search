The idea of a dinosaur attack is scary in any light, but Crichton ups the suspense a notch by narrating much of the dinosaur attack scenes from the perspective of Tim, a young boy. We are compelled reader to imagine what this eleven-year-old feels when assaulted by a full-grown tyrannosaurus. Tim makes for a good perspective: he is exceptionally intelligent, mature for his age, thinks quickly on his feet, and has a particular interest in dinosaurs. In fact, Tim often shows that he is more knowledgeable about dinosaurs than many of the "experts" who work at Jurassic Park. In this way, Crichton uses Tim used to show how irresponsibly Hammond and InGen have used science. Dr. Wu does not even know the names of the dinosaurs he is creating, while an eleven-year-old boy knows seemingly everything there is to know about all the animals in the park.

Already familiar with Grant's research when he meets him, Tim immediately looks up to the paleontologist. Tim's parents are in the middle of a divorce, and Lex constantly points out the disparity between Tim's interests and those of his father. His father is a sports nut who simply does not understand why Tim would be fascinated with a dead, ancient species such as dinosaurs. Grant, then, takes on a surrogate father role for Tim, encouraging his thoughts and ideas about the dinosaurs in the park and being a good friend throughout the crisis that befalls the park.
