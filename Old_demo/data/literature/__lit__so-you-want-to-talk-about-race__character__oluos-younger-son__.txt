Eight-year-old children should be playful and joyful. Instead, Oluo’s son is nervous and upset, despite loving school. First, he feels uncomfortable saying the pledge of allegiance, which he believes is a lie. Then, he is nervous about the possibility that adults might yell at him for his thoughtful decision not to say it. Adults sometimes forget that children are keenly aware of everything that happens around them, and they are capable of deep reflection on what they see. Oluo’s son has clear, strong reasons for not wanting to say the pledge, and with his mother’s help, he can negotiate with the school authorities to stand his ground. The fact that some adults continue to intimidate Oluo’s son with threats of violence is a sign of how far America must still travel to attain liberty and justice for all.
