As soon as Jotham and Zeena set out for Bettsbridge, Ethan
					departs to deliver the lumber load to Andrew Hale. During his journey,
					he is consumed by thoughts of his return to Mattie, imagining their
					first night alone together. After recounting these thoughts, the
					narrator segues smoothly into a description of the circumstances
					that surrounded Ethan’s courtship of Zeena and their subsequent
					marriage. When Zeena came to help Ethan nurse his mother, her arrival
					made him feel less lonely. Fearing the return of his loneliness
					when his mother died, Ethan asked Zeena to marry him. He had originally planned
					to sell the farm and move to a larger town, but Zeena’s illness
					soon rendered his dream impossible.

Since he mentioned to Zeena that he would be receiving
					cash for the lumber load, Ethan decides to go ahead and ask Andrew
					Hale for a small direct payment. After unloading the lumber, Hale
					invites Ethan into his office, and Ethan requests an advance of
					fifty dollars. Hale politely refuses, citing his own financial constraints,
					and after a further exchange of civilities, Ethan leaves Hale to
					conduct some other business in the village.

With the afternoon drawing to a close, the street stands
					relatively empty. After an interval of solitude, a swiftly moving
					horse-drawn sleigh carrying Denis Eady passes Ethan and heads in
					the direction of the Frome farm. Ethan feels a fleeting pang of
					jealousy, which he quickly suppresses as unworthy of his affections
					for Mattie. Under the cover of the Varnum spruces, Ethan happens
					upon Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum, locked together in a clandestine
					embrace. Realizing that they are being watched, the kissing couple
					quickly separates and departs. Ethan is left to reminisce about
					the scene, which, he notes, has taken place in the very spot where
					he and Mattie stood hesitating the previous night.

Ethan makes the long climb back to the farm. When he arrives, he
					looks up to see a light issuing from Mattie’s bedroom. He imagines
					her preparing herself for supper, and he thinks back to the evening
					of her arrival, when she had taken such care with her appearance.
					On his way to the house, Ethan passes a gravestone that he has often
					considered a curiosity. It marks the resting place of one of his
					ancestors, also named Ethan Frome, as well as that of the ancestor’s
					wife, who was named Endurance. They dwelled together
						in peace for fifty years, the stone announces. Ethan wonders
					if the same words will be written about him and Zeena.

Arriving home, Ethan finds the door locked. Mattie opens
					it, in her usual dress but with a streak of crimson ribbon in her
					hair. She has carefully set the supper table for Ethan with festive
					treats and colorful serving dishes. After Ethan removes his outerwear,
					he returns to the kitchen, where Mattie has put the teakettle on
					the table. She playfully admits to entertaining Jotham Powell over
					a cup of coffee, which makes Ethan prickle slightly with jealousy.
					At supper, the cat jumps up onto the table, upsetting and breaking
					a pickle dish. The accident drives Mattie to tears, because Zeena
					had forbidden her ever to use the dish, a favorite wedding present
					of Zeena’s that came all the way from Philadelphia. Ethan confidently
					consoles her, balancing the fragments into a convincing whole high
					atop the closet, where it would be unlikely that Zeena could detect
					the breakage. Having averted the disaster, Ethan and Mattie settle
					back down at the table to finish their supper.

Ethan’s silent fascination with the gravestone outside
					his house displays the extent to which his life is permeated by
					the severe, Puritan notion that all human action is predetermined.
					As he stares at the gravestone, which memorializes the lives and
					fifty-year marriage of ethan frome and endurance his
						wife, Ethan believes his own fate is spelled out before
					him. The former Frome’s wife’s name seems to embody Ethan’s own
					situation: he no longer lives life but merely endures. Although
					Ethan fully recognizes the obstacle that Zeena poses to his happiness,
					he refuses to act to rectify the situation.

Although Ethan believes that the course of his own marriage
					is fated by the marriage of his ancestor, the narrative plays upon
					the relationship between past and present within Ethan’s own life. When
					Ethan attempts to rebel against his situation, his feelings for Mattie
					develop in a curious replay of his earlier courtship of Zeena. First,
					Ethan felt he needed Zeena, a family cousin who came to care for
					his mother. Now, Ethan finds himself falling for Mattie, a family cousin
					who has come to care for his wife. The narrative plays upon this
					parallel when Ethan comes home from his business transaction to
					find the porch door locked, just as he did the previous night—only
					this time it is Mattie and not Zeena who comes to the door.

The illusion of a man-and-wife evening is set into motion
					but with a difference, symbolized by the crimson ribbon in Mattie’s
					hair. In its coloring, the ribbon refers back to the daring cherry-colored scarf
					that Mattie wears at the dance hall. It alludes to the scarlet letter
					that Hester Prynne wears to symbolize her transgression in Nathaniel
					Hawthorne’s classic Puritan novel The Scarlet Letter.


When the couple sits down to dinner, Wharton begins to
					describe the nooks and crannies of social artifice. The festive,
					rather impulsive-seeming, and sexually symbolic dishes Mattie has
					prepared—blueberries, pickles, doughnuts—indicate Mattie’s awareness
					of the evening’s clearly illicit nature. Nevertheless, Ethan and
					Mattie conduct the opening motions of their first supper alone with
					all of the elaborate gestures and rituals that might occur in the
					most fashionable cosmopolitan salon. Their stiff formality is shattered—literally—when
					the cat breaks Zeena’s favorite wedding present, symbolizing the
					way that Mattie may break up Zeena and Ethan’s marriage. Ethan’s
					response to the broken dish is also symbolic. Rather than securing
					the shattered dish permanently with glue or simply throwing away
					the pieces and admitting that the dish has been broken, Ethan arranges
					the fragments into a delicate balance, postponing disaster. The
					dish, and his marriage, appear unbroken, but they may in fact fall
					to pieces with the slightest disturbance.
