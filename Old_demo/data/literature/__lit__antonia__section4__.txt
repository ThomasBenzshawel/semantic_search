Almost three years after his move to Black Hawk, Jim and
					his grandparents decide to leave their farm in the countryside for
					a house on the outskirts of town. Finding himself out of work, Otto
					decides to head out west in search of adventure, and Jake decides
					to go with him. Before leaving, they help the Burdens move their
					household. One Sunday morning, they set off on a train, never to
					see Jim again.

Mr. Burden takes a post as a deacon at the Baptist church
					in Black Hawk, and Mrs. Burden helps out with the church’s social
					calendar. Jim begins attending the school in town and quickly adjusts
					to the company of his new classmates. Jim questions Ambrosch for
					any news about Ántonia whenever Ambrosch comes to town, but Ambrosch
					is taciturn and says little.

The Burdens’ nearest neighbors are the Harlings, a Norwegian
					family who also used to live on a farm. Three of the Harlings’ children are
					around Jim’s age, and their older sister, Frances, works in Mr. Harling’s
					office. In August, the Harlings’ cook leaves them, and Mrs. Burden
					convinces them to hire Ántonia.

With her warm personality and easy way, Ántonia is right
					at home among the Harlings, and she soon settles into a regular
					routine.

One evening, a visitor calls for Ántonia at the Harlings’.
					Lena Lingard, a local farm girl, has come to announce that she has
					also found work in town, as a dressmaker. The Harlings welcome Lena,
					but Ántonia treats her coolly, unsure how she is meant to receive
					her visi-tor. Jim, thinking back to the stories he has heard of
					Lena, relates her entanglement with a neighboring farmer, Ole Benson,
					who became so smitten with Lena that his jealous wife attacked her.

During the autumn, Jim sees Lena often in town. He helps
					her to shop for fabric and they trade gossip and stories about life
					in Black Hawk. Shortly before Christmas, Jim sees Lena and her brother shopping
					for Christmas presents for their mother. Lena advises her brother
					to get her monogrammed handkerchiefs, and then, teary-eyed, tells
					Jim that she misses her family very much.

As winter descends, Jim turns to various indoor amusements,
					playing at charades and dress-up and dancing with Ántonia and the Harlings
					in the evenings. Ántonia tells the Harlings a story about a man
					who, for no apparent reason, dove into a threshing machine and killed
					himself. The story upsets Nina Harling, but the memories of threshing
					time make Mrs. Harling homesick for the country.

In March, with snow still covering the landscape, excitement
					fills Black Hawk when Samson d’Arnault, a blind, black pianist,
					comes to town. Jim makes his way to the Boys’ Home, where d’Arnault and
					his manager are staying. He enters the parlor to find a raucous scene,
					a full house listening to music and gossiping away. Eventually,
					d’Arnault plays a concert of old plantation standards to an enthusiastic
					audience. During one of his numbers, d’Arnault senses the patter
					of women dancing in a neighboring room. A door opens to reveal Ántonia,
					Lena, and two of their friends dancing among themselves. After a
					bit of hesitation and plenty of encouragement from the men, the
					girls come into the parlor and join the party, dancing until d’Arnault’s
					manager shuts the piano. After the party breaks up, Jim and Ántonia
					walk home together, excited and restless.

Once Cather settles the Burdens comfortably in Black Hawk,
					her focused treatment of the landscape gives way to a scrutiny of
					the townspeople. She introduces several new characters in a very
					short time span, and, in turn, Jim’s narrative becomes less purposefully sequential
					and more episodic and anecdotal. Whereas Cather earlier presents
					an idyllic portrait of a group of people overwhelmed by a place,
					the shift to Black Hawk is mirrored by a reduction of emphasis on
					the power and importance of the land and an increased emphasis on
					the individuals in the town. In a world of finance and industry,
					people have a more businesslike and economic relationship to each
					other, as epitomized by Frances Harling’s utilitarian approach to
					her townspeople.

Another major contrast between the farm and the town is
					the emphasis that each environment places on gender roles. In the
					countryside, Jim is free to be domestic and sensitive in the company
					of women. But Jim’s arrival in town forces him to recognize his
					social identity as a male. In adjusting to school and his classmates,
					he seems to become “quite another boy,” learning to fight, swear,
					and tease the girls. The pressure to assume gendered behavior is
					equally acute on Ántonia, who gradually begins to make the shift
					from tomboyish farmhand to polished town girl. Lena Lingard also
					changes her costume, trading in her tattered farm rags for the smarter
					costumes of a dressmaker. Cather’s title for Book II is
					“The Hired Girls,” which serves as a reminder of the important connection among
					occupation, place, and sexuality, for both the young women and young
					men. This new pressure denotes another shift in the main characters’
					lives: just as Book i describes life in the
					country and Book II describes life in town,
					Book I describes the characters as children,
					while Book II describes them as young adults.
					The move to town comes with a new shift to more urban, grown-up
					interests, such as the dancing that takes place in Chapter VII.

Because the farm is associated with the past and the town
					with the present, Jim and Ántonia become nostalgic for their former existence
					in the country. Even Lena, who is most keen on the lures of the
					town life, confesses her nostalgia for her rural family life. While telling
					Jim one of her wild tales of adventure, she admits to him of her
					rustic family, “I get awful homesick for them, all the same.”

Although the shift from farm to town marginalizes the
					landscape, the harsh climate of the Nebraska prairie continues to
					dominate the flow of the narrative. Jim finds the winter a nearly unen-durable
					penalty for the pleasantness of summer. When Ántonia relates the
					story of a tramp who committed suicide by leaping into a thresher,
					the mystery for the Harlings is not in the tramp’s choice to kill
					himself but that he did so in such a lovely season as late summer. It
					is as if the Harlings conceive of pleasant weather as a boon from their
					often unforgiving environment not to be taken for granted.

One of the few breaks in the monotony of Jim’s first long
					winter in town is the visit paid to Black Hawk by Samson d’Arnault,
					the itinerant black pianist. While some may take offense at the
					coarse picture Cather paints of d’Arnault, it is difficult to imagine
					that the insensitive nature of her characterization was intentionally
					meant to wound. Although her descriptions of him at his piano—“enjoying himself
					as only a Negro can” and later, playing with a gusto “full of strong,
					savage blood”—may have been aimed to charm the audiences of 1918,
					they are more likely to provoke outrage in a modern reader. Nevertheless,
					her nostalgic and accurate portrait of part of America’s past is
					of great value as a cultural document.
