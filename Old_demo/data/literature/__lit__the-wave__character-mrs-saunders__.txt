In addition to Mr. Ross’s wife, Christy, Mrs. Saunders is one of the novel’s few characters who raise red flags about The Wave and express concerns about its fascist tendencies. It’s no coincidence that Mrs. Saunders is a leader at the county’s League of Women Voters. As she’s politically informed, active, and astute, she’s especially well-suited to see through The Wave’s false promises and foresee the harm such a movement can cause. While Mrs. Saunders’ tendency to worry a lot annoys Laurie, in this case, her worries are warranted, for just as Mrs. Saunders anticipates, The Wave quickly morphs into a cult-like movement. Characters such as Robert Billings become easily brainwashed, and a dangerous force of group conformity poses existential threats to individualism and individual rights and principles, all of which, she tells Laurie, are essential building blocks of the United States. It is Mrs. Saunders’s wisdom, guidance, and concern that help Laurie see through The Wave and, ultimately, stand up to it.
