Jenny is Jethro's only constant companion during the war. She helps Jethro in the fields, and they talk about the war. They both understand each other's thoughts and feelings, since they are very similar. Their lives are intertwined in the concern and emotions felt over the same people in the war. Jenny's love for Shadrach flourishes during the war, compounded by her worry for his life. Jethro is jealous of her ties to his old teacher but ultimately is happy for their union. Jenny is steadfast and strong, especially when learning that Shadrach is critically injured. She goes to him and marries him, then nurses him back to health. She deals with the war on her own terms too, and in many ways the war makes a woman out of her just as it makes a man out of Jethro.
