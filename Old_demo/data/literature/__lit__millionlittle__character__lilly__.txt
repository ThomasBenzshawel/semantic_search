Like many of the people in the clinic, Lilly is a profoundly
				damaged human being. She is tiny and fragile-looking and wears oversized black
				clothing. Unlike James, Lilly did not come from a loving, stable
				family. Her mother sold her into prostitution when she was a child,
				trading her virginity for a syringe full of heroin. At the time the
				story takes place, she is living with her grandmother, a kind woman
				who eventually saves enough money to send Lilly to the clinic. Though
				she has been corrupted from the time she was a child, Lilly remains
				a pure figure in James’s eyes. The clinic forbids relationships
				between male and female patients, but Lilly and James disregard
				this rule and regularly meet in a clearing in the woods. When Lilly
				is in danger of a relapse, James puts his recovery and life on the line
				to save her. Lilly’s love replaces addiction as the most important force
				in James’s life. She inspires him to get better and gives him something
				to live for.
