Although the Water Rat has never left his own small village, he exudes worldly wisdom and know-how, making him a good companion for the Mole. The Water Rat shares with the Mole his knowledge of the river, its currents, its backwaters, and its inhabitants. In fact, sharing seems indispensable to the Water Rat. Unlike the Otter or the Badger, who are more solitary creatures, the Water Rat enjoys companionship, particularly when he can gossip about his river neighbors. When left alone, he tends to fall into a dreamy, poetic state that fosters melancholy and wanderlust. This tendency leaves him susceptible to the enchanting tales the Sea Rat tells, threatening to send him on a voyage that would rob him of the comfort and security of his home and friends. With the Mole, the Water Rat learns that his village, while small, contains sufficient adventure to keep him busy for a lifetime.
