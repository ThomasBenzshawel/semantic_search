In Doon’s father’s line of work it is necessary to find usefulness in a small item that someone else might not see, and he encourages his son to pay attention to his surroundings in a similar way. He also pays attention to Doon, and sees his usefulness as well as his tendency to create obstacles for himself. He plays devil’s advocate for Doon, but always in a gentle way, never chiding or scolding. His style of parenting allows Doon to come to his own conclusions and form his own opinions.
