Pierre, whom many critics regard as a reflection of Tolstoy
				himself, attracts our sympathy in his status as an outsider to the
				Russian upper classes. His simplicity and emotional directness contrast
				with the artificiality of fakes such as the Kuragins. Though the
				attendees at Anna Pavlovna’s party consider Pierre uncouth and awkward, this
				very awkwardness emphasizes his natural unpretentiousness. We see
				his love of fun in his expulsion from St. Petersburg for excessive
				partying, and his generosity in his bank-breaking largesse toward
				friends and acquaintances following his inheritance. Pierre, though
				intelligent, is not dominated by reason, as his friend Andrew is.
				Pierre’s emotional spurts occasionally get him into trouble, as when
				his sexual passions make him prey to the self-serving and beautiful
				Helene. His madcap escape into the city of Moscow and his subsequent
				obsessive belief that he is destined to be Napoleon’s assassin show
				his submission to irrational impulses. Yet there is also a great
				nobility in Pierre’s emotions, and his search for meaning in his
				life becomes a central theme of the novel. We feel that his final marriage
				to Natasha represents the culmination of a life of moral and spiritual
				questioning.
