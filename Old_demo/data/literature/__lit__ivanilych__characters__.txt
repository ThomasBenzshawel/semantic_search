Ivan's colleague and friend. Schwartz is a well-dressed, playful, thoroughly proper man. He ignores life's unpleasantness. At Ivan's funeral, he is immune to all depressing influences and maintains his jovial and lighthearted demeanor. Ivan mentions that Schwartz reminds him very much of his former self, and thus it is clear that Schwartz is a kind of double for Ivan.
