Sharon M. Draper’s Out of My Mind is a first-person realistic fiction novel told from the point of view of Melody Brooks, a fifth grader who has cerebral palsy. Honored as National Teacher of the Year in 1997, Draper has strong insight into the experience of students. Her characterization of Melody shows an intelligent, relatable, and insightful girl, but avoids falling into the trap of idealizing a disabled character. The 2010 New York Times bestselling novel has won many awards, including Kirkus Best Children’s Book and the California Young Reader Medal.
