The reader predominantly sees Gregor’s father from Gregor’s point of view in
				the story, and for the most part, he appears as a hopeless and unkind man, concerned
				primarily with money, who isn’t particularly close to his son. We learn, for
				example, that he had a business that failed, and since its failure he has lost his
				motivation and essentially given up working, forcing Gregor to provide for the
				family and work to pay off the father’s debts. Yet despite Gregor’s help, the father
				has no sympathy for Gregor after Gregor undergoes his metamorphosis. On the day of
				Gregor’s change, the father only seems concerned about the family’s finances, and in
				the two instances when he interacts directly with Gregor in the story, he attacks
				Gregor in some way, first when he beats Gregor back into his room at the beginning
				and later when he throws the fruit at him.

These details suggest an estrangement between Gregor and his father (Kafka’s
				strained relationship with his own father, whom he viewed as alien and overbearing,
				certainly gives weight to such an interpretation). Gregor never explicitly says he
				resents his father, but it’s clear that he only works as a traveling salesman to
				make up for his father’s failure in business, suggesting he feels trapped by his
				father’s failings. Moreover, Gregor never displays the same affection for his father
				that he displays, albeit rarely, toward his mother and sister, as when he longs to
				see his mother before she and Grete begin moving the furniture out of his room.
				Adding to this sense of estrangement is the way the father is referred to in the
				story. The narrator does not name him beyond calling him “Mr. Samsa,” and in
				Gregor’s thoughts he almost always appears as “the father.”
