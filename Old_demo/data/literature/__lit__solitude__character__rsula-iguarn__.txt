Of all the characters in the novel, Úrsula Iguarán lives
				the longest and sees the most new generations born. She outlives
				all three of her children. Unlike most of her relatives, Úrsula
				is untroubled by great spiritual anxiety; in this sense, she is
				probably the strongest person ever to live in Macondo. She takes
				in Rebeca, the child of strangers, and raises her as her own daughter;
				she welcomes dozens of passing strangers to her table; she tries
				to keep the house from falling apart. Úrsula’s task is not easy,
				since all of her descendants become embroiled in wars and scandals
				that would cause any weaker family to dissolve. With Úrsula as their
				mainstay, however, the Buendías are irrevocably linked, for better
				or for worse. To keep the family together, Úrsula sometimes is quite
				harsh; for example, she kicks José Arcadio and Rebeca out of the
				house when they elope. This decision is partly a result of her unyielding
				fear of incest. Even though Rebeca and José Arcadio are not technically
				related, Úrsula is terrified that even a remotely incestuous action
				or relation will result in someone in the family having a baby with
				the tail of a pig. Her own marriage to José Arcadio Buendía is incestuous
				because they are cousins, and she constantly examines her children’s
				behavior for flaws, frequently saying, “[i]t’s worse than if he
				had been born with the tail of a pig.” Because of her fear of incest,
				Úrsula is a contradictory character: she binds the family together,
				but is terrified that incest, the extreme of family bonding, will
				bring disaster to the Buendía house.
