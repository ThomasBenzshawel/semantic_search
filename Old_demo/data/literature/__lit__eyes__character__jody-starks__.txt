Jody’s character is opposite that of Tea Cake.
He is cruel, conceited, and uninterested in Janie as a person. But
his cruelty is not a result of any specific animosity toward Janie;
rather, it is a reflection of the values that he holds and the way
that he understands his relationship to the world. Jody depends
on the exertion of power for his sense of himself; he is only happy
and secure when he feels that he holds power over those around him.
In Janie’s words, he needs to “have [his] way all [his] life, trample and
mash down and then die ruther than tuh let [him]self heah ’bout
it.” He needs to feel like a “big voice,” a force of “irresistible
maleness” before whom the whole world bows.

In order to maintain this illusion of irresistible power,
Jody tries to dominate everyone and everything around him. His entire
existence is based on purchasing, building, bullying, and political
planning. He marries Janie not because he loves her as a person
but because he views her as an object that will serve a useful purpose
in his schemes. She is young, beautiful, and stately, and thus fits
his ideal of what a mayor’s wife should be. Jody is obsessed with notions
of power, and Janie remains unfulfilled by their relationship because
these notions require her to be a mute, static object and prevent
her from growing. He forces her to tie her hair up because its phallic
quality threatens his male dominance and because its feminine beauty
makes him worry that he will lose her. Janie ultimately rebels against
Jody’s suppression of her, and by toppling his secure sense of his
own power, she destroys his will to live.
