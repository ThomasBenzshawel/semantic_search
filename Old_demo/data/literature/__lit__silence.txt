Silence by Japanese novelist Shūsaku Endō is a historical novel set in seventeenth-century Japan following the defeat of the Shimabara Rebellion, when Christians had to go underground to avoid heavy persecution by Japan’s feudal lords. Two Portuguese Jesuit missionaries travel to Japan, where they witness horrible tortures that make them question their faith. Published in 1966, the novel won the prestigious Tanizaki Prize, one of Japan’s most important literary awards. Silence was adapted into a motion picture by director Martin Scorsese in 2016.
