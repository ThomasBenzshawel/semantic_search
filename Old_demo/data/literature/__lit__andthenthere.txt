And Then There Were None, a classic mystery novel written by the celebrated English mystery writer Agatha Christie, was first published in 1939. The plot centers around ten strangers who are invited to an isolated island under various pretexts. As the guests settle in, they discover that their mysterious host accuses each of them of committing murder in the past. Stranded on the island with no means of escape, the tension rises as the characters are systematically killed off one by one, mirroring the eerie nursery rhyme, “Ten Little Soldiers.”

Set against the backdrop of a gloomy and foreboding island, the novel is a masterful exploration of suspense, paranoia, and moral ambiguity. Christie’s intricate plot keeps readers guessing until the very end, and the psychological depth of the characters adds layers of complexity to the narrative. Published during a tumultuous time in history, on the eve of the outbreak of World War II, And Then There Were None reflects the anxieties of its era. Its enduring popularity is evident in the numerous adaptations it has inspired, including a 1945 film version directed by René Clair.
