The central male presence in the novel, Babamukuru is a cold and enigmatic
				figure who is difficult to penetrate. While the book’s point of view is
				decidedly female, Babamukuru enacts the pressures and duties placed on men
				attempting to raise their families’ status and to shake off the specter of
				poverty. Babamukuru’s intelligence, ambition, and accomplishments are often
				taken for granted by others, as it is the others who reap the benefits of his
				hard work without attaining a full understanding of the sacrifices involved. His
				dual roles as parent and administrator are often at odds. He uses his job as
				headmaster to avoid any form of emotional intimacy with the women who share his
				home with him. His relationship with Nyasha is especially fraught, since her
				general conduct and academic performance at the mission school reflect his
				abilities not only as a father but also as a leader.

From his earliest days, Babamukuru is the pawn of those who have offered
				him assistance and opportunity. He feels he has no choice but to accept the
				charity that the administrators at the mission school extend to him. After
				completing his education in South Africa, he does not want to pursue a higher
				degree in England, and he realizes that the hope of a brighter future for his
				extended family rests solely on his shoulders. Babamukuru stoically accepts his
				duty, even if he risks being viewed as a haughty authoritarian or unsympathetic
				bully by dictating what direction his family will take. He may not wish to be
				the leader, stern taskmaster, and voice of moral guidance in his family, but if
				he does not accept that role, his relatives will not be able to alter their
				circumstances on their own. Partly because of Babamukuru’s story and life
				experiences, Tambu realizes there are multiple interpretations to the choices
				that individuals make and the motives behind those choices.
