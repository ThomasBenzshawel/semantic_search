As the youngest and newest Glader who serves as a Slopper, the lowest position in the Glade hierarchy, Chuck desperately wants to fit in with the other Gladers, though they often overlook and dismiss him. Chuck’s confidence grows after Thomas arrives and Chuck is able to relinquish his Greenie role. He knows little more about the Glade than Thomas does, though Chuck often covers his cluelessness and fear with false bravado. Chuck is the most childlike member of the group and often uses jokes and constant chatter to get through his days in the Glade. While many Gladers, including Thomas, often find Chuck to be unbearably annoying, it becomes apparent that Chuck is merely attempting to be a kid in a world full of adult responsibilities and life-or-death consequences. As he develops a friendship with Thomas, he also reveals a strong longing for the home and family he has lost. Chuck’s tender confessions ultimately cast him as a symbol of hope and home. His goal to be accepted manifests most powerfully in the brotherly relationship he develops with Thomas. Chuck’s loyalty to Thomas inspires newfound bravery and persistence as he establishes himself as an essential member of the group.
