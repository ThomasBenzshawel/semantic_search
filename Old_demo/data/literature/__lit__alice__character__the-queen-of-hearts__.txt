As the ruler of Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is the
				character that Alice must inevitably face to figure out the puzzle
				of Wonderland. In a sense, the Queen of Hearts is literally the
				heart of Alice’s conflict. Unlike many of the other characters in
				Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is not as concerned with nonsense
				and perversions of logic as she is with absolute rule and execution.
				In Wonderland, she is a singular force of fear who even dominates
				the King of Hearts. In the Queen’s presence, Alice finally gets
				a taste of true fear, even though she understands that the Queen
				of Hearts is merely a playing card. The Gryphon later informs Alice
				that the Queen never actually executes anyone she sentences to death,
				which reinforces the fact that the Queen of Hearts’s power lies
				in her rhetoric. The Queen becomes representative of the idea that
				Wonderland is devoid of substance.
