In contrast to her younger sister, Cecilia has no sense of control over her life, nor does she desire it very much. Throughout Part One of the novel, Cecilia’s thoughts and actions are often at odds with one another. She knows she has several options for her next step after Cambridge but cannot will herself to take them. Even after resolving to move to London and find a job when Leon offers to let her stay with him in London, Cecilia demurs. Cecilia feels responsible for her family, though she also resents those responsibilities. It is not until she receives Robbie’s note that Cecilia realizes she is in love with him and that her feelings are what have been keeping her from moving forward in life. However, their romance ends almost as soon as it begins once Robbie is arrested. Cecilia, furious at her family, cuts them off and becomes a nurse, only to die during a bomb raid in 1940. Cecilia’s story shows how, though Briony did not intend to bring harm to Cecilia and in fact was trying to protect her, misconceptions such as the one Briony had can lead to irrevocable consequences.
