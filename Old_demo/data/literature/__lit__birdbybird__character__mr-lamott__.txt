Lamott’s father is a central inspiration in Lamott’s novel Hard Laughter.
				In Bird by Bird, Lamott depicts him as a central
				figure in her life, although she focuses more on the effect of his
				writing rather than on her father himself. In fact, she does not
				reveal his name, or the kind of books he wrote. She does portray
				him as a free thinker with a bohemian circle of friends. Lamott
				remembers his friends staying for dinner and drinking too much when
				she was a child. She also emphasizes her father’s discipline. He
				woke up at the same time each day—a practice that Lamott herself
				advocates—and began writing promptly after breakfast. His writing
				was often controversial; for example, he wrote a disparaging essay
				about Lamott’s hometown. Lamott is alternately thrilled and embarrassed
				by her father’s career as a writer, and her father is a steadfast
				supporter of hers. He encourages her to write a novel about his
				illness in the same way he encouraged her to go to the library every
				week to read.
