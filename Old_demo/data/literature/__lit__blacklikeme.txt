Black Like Me is a nonfiction work by journalist John Howard Griffin that was published in 1961. In the 1950s, a color line existed throughout the segregated Deep South. Using medication that darkened his skin to deep brown, John Howard Griffin crossed that line by temporarily leaving his privileged life as a Southern white man to experience the disenfranchised world of an unemployed Black man by posing as one. In Black Like Me, records his experiences as Griffin explores themes of racism, segregation, and the human capacity for love amid the turbulent climate of Black society in 1959.
