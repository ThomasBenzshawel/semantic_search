Clifford is a complex character whose extended undeserved
				prison time makes him both unlikable and pitiable. His frequent
				bouts of weeping and his pitiable cries when the Judge approaches
				make him seem like a wounded or feeble animal. Clifford is a “sybarite,” someone
				who relishes natural beauty, luxury, and pleasure, which makes his
				incarceration seem all the more cruel and unbearable. Hawthorne
				makes luxuries seem more important to Clifford than food. He is
				also temperamental and brash, and despite his nearly imbecilic state,
				he still manages to be cruel to his adoring sister, even after three
				decades of separation. In the end, however, Clifford’s weaknesses
				convey the extent of his degradation. Prison has ruined him. A formerly
				beautiful, confident, and life-loving person, Clifford has become
				like a broken beast, cringing in fear as his persecutor passes.
				Hawthorne doesn’t make a martyr out of Clifford (someone who sacrifices
				himself for a cause greater than his own life), but he does not
				create a monster either. Instead, Hawthorne presents Clifford as
				a tragic victim of fate by balancing what Clifford has become against
				what he was before forces beyond his control led him to confinement
				and despair.
