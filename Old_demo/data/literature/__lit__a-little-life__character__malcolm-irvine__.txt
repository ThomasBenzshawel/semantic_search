Were he not so privileged, Malcolm Irvine might border on tragic. Instead, he comes off as indecisive and cowardly. Malcolm is an architect, and he excels at designing small, interior spaces. This talent is likely a result of the fact that he spends much of mental and emotional energy exploring such spaces within his own psyche and those of his friends and family. Malcolm is often set as a foil against JB to highlight each characterâ€™s failings. Malcolm is overly concerned about what people think, whereas JB is deliberatively provocative. Malcolm could be an excellent friend if he put more energy into caring for others. Instead, he internalizes potential criticism and endlessly questions his own choices. Only after his reputation is secure is he able to truly listen to others, making his death particularly poignant.
