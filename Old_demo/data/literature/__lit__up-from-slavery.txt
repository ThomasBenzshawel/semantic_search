Up From Slavery is the autobiography of Black American educator Booker T. Washington that was first published in 1901. It chronicles Washington’s life from his birth in slavery in the late 1850s to the turn of the 20th century, when he was a nationally known figure promoting his school in Tuskegee, Alabama, and his controversial philosophy of “racial uplift.” While there is still widespread disagreement about many Washington’s ideas, most critics agree that Up From Slavery tells a full story of his life and clearly conveys his theory for the social and political advancement of Black Americans.
