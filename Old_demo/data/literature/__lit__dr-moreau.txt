Written in 1896 by H.G. Wells, one of the pioneers of modern science fiction, The Island of Dr. Moreau tells the tale of an English traveler shipwrecked on a remote island governed by Dr. Moreau, a mad scientist bent on transforming animals into humans. The narrator’s harrowing encounters with the “Beast Folk” who populate the island cause him to question what it means to be human. The Island of Dr. Moreau is one of Wells' most popular books, and it has inspired several spin-off novels as well as being adapted into film.
