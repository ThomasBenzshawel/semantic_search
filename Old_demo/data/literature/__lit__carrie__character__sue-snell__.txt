As a popular senior at Ewen High School, Sue tends to define herself in the terms that she believes the rest of her group values. She is seen as the golden girl, the future housewife, and is constantly in fear that her mask will slip and others will shun her if they see who she really is. Sue is more mature than her friends, and this maturity grants her the ability to perceive the reality of Carrie’s situation and understand the moral implications of what her peers are doing to Carrie.

Though she values Tommy’s opinion of her and worries that she will disappoint him, Sue is also mature enough to make herself vulnerable to Tommy despite the potential risk. When she does this, she gains an even deeper understanding of what it is like to be in a mature relationship and empathize with others. Sue employs her empathy both in her final moments with Carrie, and in the way that she depicts Carrie and even Carrie’s tormentors in her autobiography.
