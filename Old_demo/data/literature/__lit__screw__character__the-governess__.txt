Although the governess adores Miles and Flora when she
				first meets them, she quickly becomes suspicious of their every
				word and action, convinced that they hope to deceive her. She is
				fickle, however, and frequently switches back to being absolutely
				sure of their pure innocence. At these times, her affection for
				the children can be intense. She embraces them often and with passion,
				going so far as to kiss Miles. The ambiguity of the text allows
				these displays of affection to appear both harmless and inappropriate.
				Her volatile relationship with the children renders her an unreliable
				narrator and a dubious source of information. According to Douglas,
				the governess’s confidant and admirer, she is “the most agreeable
				person” he has ever known “in her position.” However, he says also
				that she was “in love,” as though this is an excuse for her behavior,
				which he admits is questionable. Mrs. Grose’s increasing skepticism
				casts doubt on the governess’s visions and fears and suggests that
				the governess may indeed be losing her mind. 

The governess, with her overabundant concern for the children
				and her violent suspicions of them, may be regarded as either a
				heroine or a villain. On one hand, she seems to be an ambitious
				young woman who unwittingly places herself in a position in which
				she is forced to struggle heroically to protect her charges from
				supernatural forces. On the other hand, she seems to be a sheltered,
				inexperienced young woman whose crush on her employer and nervous
				exhaustion at being in charge of two strange children result in
				an elaborate and ultimately dangerous fabrication or hallucination.
				James provides only the governess’s side of the story, which may
				be inaccurate in whole or in part. In any case, the governess’s
				account is by no means the full account, which we never learn.
