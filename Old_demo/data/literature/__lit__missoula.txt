Missoula is a true crime book by nonfiction author Jon Krakauer that was first published in 2015. In 2010, a private investigation by the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana, found that rapes were going unreported at the University. Following this report and several high-profile alleged rapes involving members of the University of Montana football team, the U.S. Department of Justice launched its own federal investigation into sexual assault in Missoula. Krakauerâ€™s investigation followed in the wake of this intense scrutiny of rape in Missoula.
