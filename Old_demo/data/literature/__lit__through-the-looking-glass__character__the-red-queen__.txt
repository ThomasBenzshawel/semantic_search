The Red Queen behaves like the quintessential Victorian
				governess. She is overbearing, meticulously obsessive about manners,
				and civil in a self-righteous and supercilious way. Like the vast
				majority of the characters in Through the Looking-Glass,
				the Red Queen makes definitive statements with little regard for
				an abiding logic that would support them. Her assertions are often
				arbitrary recitations of strict behavioral advice, such as, “Speak
				when you’re spoken to!” When Alice reveals the inadequacy of the
				logic behind the Red Queen’s statements, the Red Queen asserts her
				arbitrary position of authority as a justification. The Red Queen’s
				constant badgering of and competition with Alice indicates profound
				feelings of antagonism. She fits into the framework of Alice’s dream
				as representative arbitrary authority, serving as a caricature of
				an overbearing governess figure at odds with her young charges.
