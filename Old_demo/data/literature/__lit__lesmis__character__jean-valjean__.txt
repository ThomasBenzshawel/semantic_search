Jean Valjean stands at the center of Les Misérables and
				becomes a trial figure for Hugo’s grand theories about the redemptive
				power of compassion and love. Valjean goes into prison a simple
				and decent man, but his time in jail has a seemingly irreversible
				effect on him, and he emerges from the chain gang a hardened criminal
				who hates society for what it has done to him. By the time Valjean
				encounters M. Myriel in Digne, he is so accustomed to being a social
				pariah that he almost seeks out such abuse, greeting even the kindly
				bishop with scorn and hatred. Myriel, however, turns out to be the
				first person in decades to treat Valjean with love and respect.
				The meeting with Myriel forever changes Valjean’s character, as
				Myriel makes Valjean promise to become an honest man.

Once Valjean opens up his heart, he becomes a testament
				to the redemptive power of love and compassion. His hard work and
				new vision transform the derelict town of Montreuil-sur-mer into
				a thriving manufacturing center, which in turn teaches Valjean the value
				of philanthropy. In taking care of Cosette, Valjean learns how to
				love another person and how to pass that love onto others. He is exceptional
				only in his physical strength and his willingness to discover what
				is good, and this earnestness is enough to make him the novel’s
				hero as well as a savior and a friend to a number of people who
				find themselves in danger. Hardened by prison and rescued by the
				kindness of M. Myriel, Valjean is a blank slate, molded by his encounters
				and circumstances. This ability to change makes him a universal
				symbol of hope—if he can learn love and charity after suffering
				so much injustice, anyone can.
