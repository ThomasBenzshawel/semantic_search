Sara acts first and foremost as a mother throughout the novel, and her need to
				keep her daughter, Kate, alive motivates her more than any other impulse. Whatever
				other problem she encounters, be it Jesse’s delinquency or Anna’s need for
				independence, the matter holds less importance for her than Kate’s survival.
				Paradoxically, by focusing so much on being a mother to Kate, Sara does not always
				fill the role of mother for her other children. For instance, Sara tends to
				disregard Jesse’s self-destructive behavior, which Jesse uses to call out for
				attention, and she doesn’t stop to think that Anna might be genuinely unhappy when
				Anna files the lawsuit for medical emancipation. Although Sara undoubtedly loves
				Jesse and Anna, she has difficulty considering them as people separate from Kate.
				Similarly, though Sara is a wife to Brian and a sister to Zanne, her relationships
				with these people also revolve around Kate. Sara struggles to talk to Brian about
				anything other than Kate, for instance, and the few times she sees her sister occur
				when Zanne comes to take care of Jesse and Anna because Sara is going with Kate to
				the hospital. Even with Kate, Sara focuses mostly on her physical, rather than
				emotional, health. For example, when Anna reveals on the stand that Kate doesn’t
				want to live any longer, Sara does not believe it because she has never spoken to
				Kate about these feelings.
