Baron Harkonnen appears infrequently in the novel, but
				he initiates an important sequence of events that changes the future
				of the universe. He deviously tries to murder the entire House of
				A-treides and hopes to control the empire by having a monopoly on
				spice. His grandiose plans even include becoming the new emperor.
				Ironically, the baron’s plans drive Paul to become the leader of
				the Fremen and eventually leader of the universe. The baron is clearly
				marked as the novel’s main antagonist from his very first appearance.
				He is ruthless, ambitious, cruel, and so fat that he requires antigravity
				devices to suspend his bulk.

The baron appears like an unrealistic caricature of a
				leader. On the surface, he is not very different from Duke Leto.
				Both men are ambitious and ruthless. Leto, however, genuinely cares
				about his own men and family and regrets many of the tactics he
				must use to protect them, such as poisoning his rivals and raiding
				their supplies. The baron seems to delight in the intricacies of
				political warfare, and his regard for his family extends no further
				than his beloved nephew Feyd-Rautha. The personalities of the leaders
				of the other houses fall somewhere between those of Leto and the
				baron.

The baron’s villainous qualities are reflected in his
				sexual tastes, most notably his predatory preference for young boys.
				The novel suggests that the baron’s affection for Feyd-Rautha stems
				largely from the nephew’s youth, and we even see hints that the
				baron quietly lusts after Paul Atreides. Oddly enough, no other
				character in the novel takes a stance on the baron’s perverse sexual
				tastes. The result is a disturbing ambiguity that leaves the moral
				boundaries of Herbert’s imagined world unclear.
