The narrator tells us that Sir Leicester has the gout
					in his legs, a malady all the men in his family have suffered from.
					The narrator ponders what connection there could be between Lady
					Dedlock and Sir Leicester, their homes, the young Jo, and many other
					people.

Jo lives in a place called Tom-all-Alone’s, where houses
					collapse. Tom Jarndyce may have once lived here, but Jo doesn’t
					know for sure.

The narrator tries to imagine what it’s like to be Jo,
					not really belonging anywhere and not knowing anything. Jo moves
					through the town, observing people and animals trying to get enough
					money to go back to Tom-all-Alone’s.

Mr. Tulkinghorn sits in his office doing work. On the
					street below, a woman walks by. The narrator implies she is on some
					secret errand. Determinedly, she seeks out Jo, who asks her for
					money. She ignores him and crosses the street, then beckons him
					over. She asks if she has read about the dead lodger in the newspaper
					because of the court case regarding him. She tries to get Jo to
					acknowledge that the dead man looks like him. Jo asks if she knew
					the dead man, and she grows defensive. The woman asks Jo to show
					her all the places he knows of relating to the death, including
					where the man was buried. He is to walk far ahead of her and not
					speak to her.

Jo leads the woman to Cook’s Court, Krook’s shop, and
					the burial ground. She gives him some a gold coin and hurries away.

The narrator tells us that Lady Dedlock goes to a dinner
					and several parties, while Sir Leicester stays home. Mrs. Rouncewell,
					the housekeeper, observes that the footsteps on the Ghost’s Walk
					are louder than they have ever been.

Esther says that Richard visits London frequently. Esther
					loves Richard but regrets that he seems unable to concentrate and
					lacks ambition. Mr. and Mrs. Badger arrive one day and tell Esther
					that Richard is a fine young man, but Mrs. Badger confesses that
					she thinks he has chosen his profession badly. He is not passionate enough
					about it. Mr. Badger agrees.

When Richard arrives the next day, he confirms that he
					isn’t that interested in medicine, but that it’s good enough. He
					says each day is too much like the one before, which Esther points
					out is how life generally is. She and Ada encourage him to change
					direction. Richard says he might like to work with Mr. Kenge and
					study law. Mr. Jarndyce supports the decision, although he seems
					troubled when he looks at Ada.

Esther says she has trouble sleeping, but she is evasive
					about why. She tries to talk herself out of her low spirits and
					go to sleep, but she can’t. She begins doing some embroidery and
					goes downstairs to find some silk. She comes across Mr. Jarndyce,
					who is still awake and looks troubled. He tells her she should know
					more about her history. He tells her that he got a letter describing
					a young orphan whom the writer had been raising. The writer feared
					that if she died, the child would be alone, and so she wrote to
					ask Mr. Jarndyce if he would serve as guardian if that should happen.
					He wrote back saying yes. He had to agree never to see the writer
					but to send a confidential agent, so Mr. Jarndyce appointed Mr.
					Kenge. The writer said she was the child’s aunt. Mr. Jarndyce says
					he is so happy to have taken on this child—Esther. Esther replies
					gratefully that he is like a father to her, a comment that seems
					to bother him. Esther doesn’t understand his reaction.

The next day, Mr. Woodcourt arrives for a brief visit
					before going away on a long trip to China and India. Esther tells
					us that he isn’t rich and is seven years older than she is, although
					she says these details are irrelevant. She says everyone is sorry
					that he’s leaving.

He brings his mother to dinner. Mrs. Woodcourt is confident
					that he will meet some English ladies in India and that birth and
					lineage are of utmost importance. Esther wonders idly what Mrs.
					Woodcourt would think of her own birth.

After they leave, Caddy (Miss Jellyby) arrives with a
					small bouquet of flowers. Esther assumes they are from Prince Turveydrop because
					they look like flowers from a lover. Caddy reveals that they were
					actually left behind at Miss Flite’s by someone for Esther. She hints
					that this person was very good to Miss Flite and was going away
					on a trip. Later, Ada laughs and teases Esther about the flowers
					being from a lover. Esther doesn’t reveal who they are all referring
					to.

Esther, Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce are back at Bleak House,
					and Richard goes to work for Mr. Kenge. Mr. Jarndyce finds lodging
					for Richard in London, and Richard spends money wildly.

Esther, Ada, Mr. Jarndyce, and Mr. Skimpole go to visit
					Mr. Boythorn, who lives in Lincolnshire. Mr. Boythorn leads them
					to his house but must take an inconvenient route because he has
					sworn not to set foot on Sir Leicester’s property, Chesney Wold,
					which is right next to his own. However, he tells the guests that
					they may explore Sir Leicester’s park. Esther says that Chesney
					Wold appears beautiful and peaceful.

In the village, Mr. Boythorn greets a young man who he
					explains is Mrs. Rouncewell’s grandson, and who is in love with
					a young girl staying with Lady Dedlock.

Mr. Boythorn’s house is pretty and comfortable, although
					Mr. Boythorn has put up several signs threatening trespassers, namely Sir
					Leicester. The day after they arrive, the group explores the park. In
					a church, they see several pretty young women, including the woman
					Mr. Boythorn had commented on. She is standing with the housekeeper.
					Near her is a Frenchwoman, who is glaring at her.

Esther glances around the church, and a woman catches
					Esther’s eye. Esther has a violent reaction. She has a feeling that
					is similar to the feelings she had at her godmother’s house, when
					she would play with her doll and look at herself in the mirror.
					In fact, the woman’s face is like a mirror in which Esther sees
					old memories. But Esther knows she has never seen this woman before.
					She figures out that this woman is Lady Dedlock. Esther is incredibly
					agitated.

A week later, Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Esther are walking
					in the park when it begins raining. They take shelter in a groundskeeper’s lodge.
					Someone asks if it is dangerous. Ada thinks Esther has spoken, but
					it is Lady Dedlock, who is also in the lodge. Esther has another
					violent reaction to the voice because it makes her think of herself.

Lady Dedlock introduces herself to Mr. Jarndyce and Ada.
					Mr. Jarndyce introduces Esther as his ward, and Lady Dedlock hastily turns
					away. Lady Dedlock asks Mr. Jarndyce if he knew her sister when
					they were abroad, and he says that he did. Lady Dedlock says she
					and her sister have gone their separate ways.

A carriage arrives for Lady Dedlock, carrying the pretty
					young girl and the Frenchwoman. Lady Dedlock had requested only
					the young girl, but the Frenchwoman had come as well. There is no room
					in the carriage for the Frenchwoman after Lady Dedlock gets in,
					so she walks after it in the rain, barefoot.

The narrator describes a long vacation in Chancery Lane.
					It is summertime, and many courts are out of session. Everyone goes
					on vacation. Mr. Snagsby, the law-stationer, relaxes, and he and
					Mrs. Snagsby invite Mr. and Mrs. Chadband over. Mr. Chadband has
					the habit of making grand lectures instead of speaking normally.
					He lectures everyone tirelessly.

Guster tells Mr. Snagsby there is someone in the shop
					to see him. It is a police constable holding a young boy by the
					arm. The constable tells Mr. Snagsby that the boy won’t leave the
					area as he had been asked to. The boy, Jo, says he has nowhere to
					go. The constable says Jo claims to know Mr. Snagsby, which Mr.
					Snagsby says he does, from the inquest regarding the dead man. He
					doesn’t reveal that he gave Jo a half-crown to keep quiet. At that
					moment, Mr. Guppy enters the room, and the constable says that Mr.
					Guppy said that Mr. Snagsby is respectable. Mr. Guppy had seen the
					confusion outside and was looking into it.

Jo tells everyone about a lady who gave him money to show
					her where the dead man was buried. Mr. Guppy is interested in Jo’s story
					about the lady and starts asking him questions. Mrs. Snagsby invites
					him upstairs, and Jo follows. Mr. Guppy continues to ask him questions.
					Mrs. Chadband reveals that she has known Kenge and Carboy’s office
					for years, because of a situation concerning a child. She explains
					that she was left in charge of a child named Esther Summerson. Mr.
					Guppy tells her that he met Esther in London.

Mr. Chadband compliments Jo and talks on and on about
					his lot in life. Jo finally escapes.

The narrator says that the long summer vacation continues.
					Mr. Guppy is restless. He and Richard work together in Kenge and
					Carboy’s office, although Mr. Guppy is jealous that Richard is staying
					in Kenge’s room. Mr. Guppy suspects everyone of being out to get
					him. He is glad that Richard spends so much time reading papers
					about Jarndyce and Jarndyce, since he knows only failure can come
					from it. Another young man is in the office as well, Young Smallweed (also
					called Chick), who works as a clerk. Although he is only fifteen he
					seems unusually wise.

One day a man named Jobling arrives and goes to dinner
					with Mr. Guppy and Smallweed. Everyone at the restaurant respects Smallweed.
					Mr. Jobling eats copiously. They talk about Jobling’s professional
					problems. Jobling considers enlisting, but Mr. Guppy suggests he
					try to get work from Mr. Snagsby. Mr. Guppy hints around at his
					connection to the Snagsbys—namely, what happened when he was last
					at their home—but he refuses to clarify. Mr. Guppy also says that
					he has been giving money to Miss Flite, and that he knows about
					Mr. Krook’s lodging house. He says Mr. Krook could rent Mr. Jobling
					a room. Mr. Guppy reveals that he thinks Mr. Krook is very wealthy.
					Mr. Guppy tells Jobling that Krook’s last lodger died, but Jobling
					doesn’t mind.

Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling visit Krook, who is asleep.
					Startled, Krook tries to hit Mr. Guppy, and then he wakes up fully.
					Krook shows Jobling the room. Later, Mr. Guppy introduces Jobling
					to the Snagsbys, who agree to give him work.

Jobling moves into his new room. In town, women gossip
					about him and speculate that he has come for Krook’s money.

Although Dickens has introduced many storylines in the
					first fifteen chapters of Bleak House, he doesn’t
					begin to weave those storylines together until chapter 16.
					Near the beginning of the chapter, the narrator says, “What connexion
					can there have been between many people . . . who . . . have . . .
					been very curiously brought together!” Indeed, characters and plots
					that so far have seemed independent now begin to come together,
					and characters are revealed to be related to one another in unexpected
					ways. For example, we learn that Lady Dedlock knows of Jo and is
					strangely interested in learning what happened to Krook’s dead lodger.
					Her appearance in Jo’s hardscrabble world is surprising, and her
					intense reaction to the lodger’s burial place is mysterious. Dickens
					never explicitly tells us that the woman in those scenes is Lady
					Dedlock, but context clues suggest that this is the case. We also
					learn that the Snagsby’s friend Mrs. Chadband was Esther’s old guardian, Rachael.
					Perhaps most important, we begin to see a connection between Esther
					and Lady Dedlock. The first clues arise when Esther visits Mr. Boythorn’s
					home, which is next to Chesney Wold, and spots Lady Dedlock at church.
					When their eyes meet, Esther is stunned—she thinks she recognizes
					Lady Dedlock somehow, but she is certain she has never met her before.
					During this same visit, Lady Dedlock alludes to a time in the past
					when Mr. Jarndyce was well acquainted with her sister. These clues,
					suggestions, and interconnections add richness and intrigue to the
					world of Bleak House.

Richard’s struggle to find a vocation suggests the importance
					of passion in building a fulfilling life. Richard idly follows whatever path
					is suggested to him, never thinking very deeply about what he truly
					wants to do. He is happy enough in his medical studies, but the Badgers
					tell Esther that he is not committed enough to his work and suggest
					that medicine is not a “ruling passion” for him. Richard’s blasé
					acceptance of it suggests a lack of engagement with his life and an
					absence of ambition. Esther places so much importance on the idea
					of finding what one is passionate about that she encourages Richard
					to change fields. The idea of passion is not, however, equal to
					the idea of excitement. Richard, true to his indecisive, wayward nature,
					wants to find a career that is not so “monotonous,” but Esther points
					out that life itself is quite monotonous. Mr. Jarndyce agrees that
					Richard should change paths, but the concerned look he gives Ada
					suggests that he is worried about Richard’s restlessness and inability
					to commit himself completely to one single undertaking.

Esther is a strong, confident narrator when she is talking
					about other people, but she falters and stutters when she touches
					on matters that are very personal to her. Her descriptions are usually
					vivid and detailed, and her voice is smooth and mature, but at times
					her storytelling breaks down entirely. For example, she tells us
					in chapter 17 that she was low-spirited and
					having trouble sleeping, but when she tries to explain why, she
					blurts out, “I don’t know why. At least, I don’t think I know why.
					At least, perhaps I do, but I don’t think it matters.” This barely
					coherent babbling suggests that Esther does, indeed, know the root
					of her troubles but is unwilling to disclose it. This makes sense
					when we find out that Mr. Woodcourt is arriving the next day to
					say goodbye, as he leaves for a very long journey. When she describes
					the dinner, she stops frequently to correct her narration. “I believe—at
					least I know—that he was not rich,” she says, and “I think—I mean,
					he told us—that he has been in practice three or four years.” It
					is as though she is making an effort to be as accurate as possible
					in her narration, while at the same time covering up any possible
					hint of how she really feels about these aspects of Mr. Woodcourt’s
					character. Her stumblings suggest that there is more to the story
					than she is revealing.
