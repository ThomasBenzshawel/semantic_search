Leah is a determined, decisive, and capable woman. She
				marries Jacob, despite his love for her sister, and revels in the
				joy he finds in her arms. She’s taller than most men and more talented
				than most women: she brews excellent beer and effortlessly produces
				fine spinning. While Leah is probably the least self-centered character
				in the novel, she is self-conscious about her mismatched eyes. She
				takes care to hide them as much as possible and rewards those who
				can look into them. 

As a mother, Leah is formidable. Bearing eight healthy
				children and breastfeeding many of her nephews barely distracts
				her from her daily duties as the head of Jacob’s household. She
				is surprisingly sexual, craving Jacob’s body and enjoying the pleasures
				they find in each other. Leah proves herself to be a skilled herdsman,
				noting the mating patterns of their flocks and helping her husband
				to grow their meager beginnings into more prosperous holdings. She
				even proves herself to be cunning at times, cleverly outwitting
				her father by stitching herbs and spices into the women’s clothes
				in order to smuggle them.

Yet even with all of her talents and triumphs as a mother,
				Leah is a somewhat tragic figure. Her sister Rachel remains the
				true love of Jacob’s life, and she loses her only daughter, Dinah,
				through circumstances beyond her control. She dies pining for the
				love and comfort of her only daughter.
