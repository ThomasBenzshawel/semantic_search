King Arthur here appears as a young man, excitable and easily provoked. According to the Green Knight, Camelot has developed a reputation for its chivalric perfection in terms of hospitality and bravery thanks to Arthur’s rule, and we see aspects of this chivalry in Arthur’s behavior. He refuses to eat until everyone has been served. Even when worried about Gawain’s fate, he puts on a brave face to comfort Queen Guinevere. However, his youthful inexperience also shows. Waiting until everyone else has been served to eat is admirable, but waiting until hearing a marvelous tale seems immature and boyish. When the Green Knight taunts the court over no one rising to his challenge, Arthur volunteers himself. Despite his bravery here, Arthur risking his life foolishly could leave his kingdom unprotected. In addition, although his wary reception to the strange Green Knight may seem warranted, the contrast with Sir Bertilak’s warm reception to Sir Gawain, also an unfamiliar and armed knight appearing at his castle unannounced, brings Arthur’s hospitality into question. In this sense, Arthur’s imperfections as a ruler mirror Sir Gawain’s imperfections as a knight, making his proclamation that the whole court take up the green girdle fitting.
