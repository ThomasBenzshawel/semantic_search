After seizing the flag from the fallen color bearer, Henry
					and Wilson see the regiment slinking back toward them, the enemy
					having broken their charge. The lieutenant cries out angrily, but
					the men fall back to a row of trees, relatively safe from the deadly
					hail of gunfire. After a scuffle, Henry succeeds in pulling the
					flag away from Wilson, and bears it himself. As the men march across
					the battlefield, they are pelted with bullets, and surrounded by
					fortified groups of enemy soldiers. Henry, who entertains the notion
					of a victory as “a fine revenge upon the officer who had referred
					to him and his fellows as mule drivers,” mulls with shame and rage
					that victory is not to be. Still, he holds the flag proudly and
					urges the men to fight, even though the regiment is in tatters and
					men are beginning to scatter.

Soon, the enemy is upon Henry’s regiment, which, at the
					last minute, mounts a respectable defense. Henry comforts himself
					with the thought that if the enemy is meant to win the battle, their
					victory will at least not be an easy one. As the 304th
					fights, he is assured of its confidence in combat. In a pitched
					battle, Henry’s regiment succeeds in forcing the enemy soldiers
					to retreat. The spirits of all the men in Henry’s group are uplifted;
					they feel as though they have regained their capabilities, and proceed
					with a new enthusiasm.

At last the regiment returns to the fortified
					position of its army. The other soldiers mock the 304th
					for stopping “about a hundred feet this side of a very pretty success,”
					which fills Henry’s group with impotent rage. Looking back across
					the field from his new position of safety, Henry is astonished to
					realize that a distance that seemed so great is actually quite small—the
					line of trees from which he and his companions so perilously made
					their escape seems ridiculously near. As Henry contemplates this
					fact, the officer who called the men mule drivers suddenly rides
					up to the group. Accosting the colonel, he berates the men for their pitiful
					behavior and calls them “mud diggers.” This enrages the men, and
					a murmur rises up from the ranks about the incompetence and condescension
					of the blue army’s commanders.

As the soldiers gripe to one another, a few men approach
					Henry and Wilson, excitement glowing on their faces. They say that
					they have overheard the colonel of the regiment talking to the lieutenant about
					Henry and Wilson: the two soldiers are, in the colonel’s estimation,
					the best fighters in the regiment. Though they pretend to be uninterested
					in the report, Henry and Wilson are deeply satisfied and feel a
					renewed confidence in the war effort.

This praise fortifies Henry for the next battle, which
					he meets with “serene self-confidence.” The blue and the gray form
					for “another attack in the pitiless monotony of conflicts.” As the
					battle rages on, Henry’s regiment thins. Great losses of life and
					energy hamper the regiment, and Henry loses himself in spectatorship
					for a while. He can only stand and watch the events around him,
					but does not feel his idleness: “He did not know that he breathed;
					that the flag hung silently over him, so absorbed was he.” Henry
					maintains his resolve not to retreat, regardless of what happens,
					thinking that his dead body would be the ultimate revenge on the
					man who called the 304th Regiment “mule drivers”
					and “mud diggers.” As bullets whir in the air around him, Henry
					sees the regiment growing starker. Many of the blue soldiers are
					hit, some falling to the ground in vivid gore. Henry notes that
					Wilson and the lieutenant are unhurt, but that the regiment’s fire
					is rapidly weakening.

This short section continues Crane’s withdrawal from the
					explicit exploration of abstract themes, in favor of a graphic portrayal
					of battle. It also pushes Crane’s sardonic commentary firmly into
					the background, as the impressionistic depiction of battle scenes
					occupies all of Chapter XX. With an incredible economy of language, Crane
					is able to put the physical and psychological demands of battle
					into words:

Such details as the “voice of triple brass” and “mêlée of
					screeches” contribute to the general sense of the disorienting bedlam
					on the battlefield. They are impressionistic in that they evoke
					a distinct feeling and mood but can be interpreted in various ways.

Using a slightly different tone in Chapter XXII, Crane
					issues a startlingly convincing portrayal of the graphic violence
					of battle, one that falls into the genre of realism rather than
					impressionism:

With his meticulous attention to gory detail, Crane paints
					a haunting picture. The inclusion of such details as the manner
					in which the sergeant’s jaw hangs down and the “pulsing mass of
					blood and teeth” resonates within the reader’s imagination, and
					is effective in part because of the journalistic objectivity in
					which it is narrated.

In Chapter XXI, the regiment’s new cohesion
					is far from total: Henry and Wilson are insulted by the derisive
					officer’s disparagement of their regiment, but pleased by the individual
					praise they have won from their own officers. Henry still places
					great stock in the opinions of others. While he seems, at some moments,
					to be coming into a new sense of inner security, at others he retains
					his old narcissistic vanity, as when he imagines that his own death would
					be the ultimate revenge on the derisive officer: “It was his idea,
					vaguely formed, that his corpse would be for those eyes a great
					and salt reproach.”

Henry’s belief that his death would be significant enough
					to affect an officer who does not even know his name and who probably
					does not have the inclination to mourn individual privates, reveals
					that he has not yet fully internalized the lessons of the first part
					of the novel. He has encountered hard truths about the indifference
					of the universe that have somewhat broadened his perspective. Nevertheless,
					he is still unable to accept the idea that his death would go largely
					unnoticed. It seems to him—as, Crane implies, it does to every individual—that
					his own perception is the measure of his existence, and that the
					end of the individual consciousness would be apocalyptic for the
					entire world. The fact that Henry’s growth is not complete should
					not, however, detract from it. Henry has grown
					considerably. For instance, when the soldiers report to him the
					colonel’s praise, Henry is able to celebrate his victory with “a
					secret glance of joy” toward Wilson, a stroke of modesty of which
					he would have been incapable at the beginning of the novel. It is
					a testament to the novel’s realism that such a profound and complex
					change in character is neither immediate or easy.
