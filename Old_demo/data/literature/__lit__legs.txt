Legs is a novel by William Kennedy that was first published in 1975. It is the first in a series of eight novels set in Kennedy’s hometown of Albany, New York, in what would come to be known as his “Albany cycle.” Legs tells the story of a legendary prohibition era gangster, Jack “Legs” Diamond, who goes from being romanticized by the public in the freewheeling 1920s to being increasingly a man out of time as prohibition is coming to an end and the Great Depression is taking hold in 1931.
