The crystal merchant serves as an important friend to Santiago during
				Santiago’s time in Tangier, but he also functions as a cautionary case of someone
				who has become complacent and given up the pursuit of his Personal Legend. He
				maintains a crystal shop on the top of a hill in Tangier, and was rather successful
				until the city fell out of favor as a port. Although he is a good man who is
				devoutly religious and kind enough to take Santiago in, he fears pursuing his dream
				to make a pilgrimage to Mecca because he thinks he will have nothing to live for
				once he’s achieved his dream. The crystal merchant takes no pride in his
				conservative approach to life, but he feels rooted in his ways.

The crystal merchant is the most fully fleshed-out irredeemable character in
				The Alchemist. (The baker is another irredeemable character, as
				is Santiago’s own father, but we don’t see either of them as much as the crystal
				merchant). In other words, the novel portrays his fate as one to avoid, despite the
				fact that he comes across as a good person. The crystal merchant understands that he
				acts foolishly in not pursuing his Personal Legend, making it difficult to
				understand his motives when he refuses to change his ways, even after Santiago shows
				him the benefits of taking risks. Within the context of the story, he serves as an
				example of the dangers of an unfulfilled life, evident in his disappointment over
				his own life decisions.
