As Esiâ€™s best friend, Opokuya Dakwa inhabits a space in between the nearly
				extreme independence that Esi represents and the traditional role expected of a
				woman in the household. Like Esi, Opokuya has her own career that is personally
				and financially rewarding. She is educated and clearly has the freedom to pursue
				her career. At the same time, Opokuya has a large family and a husband. She
				struggles to manage the demands of her job and family, and it is evident that
				the two demands take their toll on her emotional well-being. Nonetheless,
				Opokuya manages to fulfill all of the roles demanded of her by her life. She is
				at once a dedicated nurse and a dedicated mother and wife, but her life is not
				easy. She begins her days fighting with her husband. The fact that she rarely
				wins their morning dispute over the car is frustrating for Opokuya, but also
				clearly not enough of a problem for her to ever contemplate leaving her husband.
				In the end, Opokuya is able to resolve her morning disputes with her husband by
				obtaining her own car, thereby demonstrating her ability to be both an
				independent, modern woman, and a loving wife.
