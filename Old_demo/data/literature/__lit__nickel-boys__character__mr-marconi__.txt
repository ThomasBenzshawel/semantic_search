Mr. Marconi is the Italian man who owns and operates the store where Elwood worked as a teenager before being sent to Nickel Academy. On the surface, Mr. Marconi is a wise business owner and a profit-driven man. Mr. Marconi established his business in the predominately African-American part of town, evolving the store’s offering to meet the changing needs of its clientele. When teenagers steal from the store, Mr. Marconi knowingly turns the other way, suggesting that the stealing actually improves his business.

Although Mr. Marconi makes many decisions under the guise of making money, his driving motivation seems to stem from his kindness.  For example, Mr. Marconi doesn’t need help running the store, yet he hires Elwood anyway. Mr. Marconi goes as far as mentoring Elwood and giving him advice to encourage Elwood’s safety and well-being. Readers could even assume that Mr. Marconi’s feigned ignorance of shoplifting is out of fondness for the neighborhood and its children. Later, Mr. Marconi also attempts to help Harriet get Elwood out of Nickel Academy through legal action, although they are ultimately unsuccessful.
