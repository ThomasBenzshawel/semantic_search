Blanca is very close to her mother and very distant from
				her father. She is raised by Clara and Ferula together and quickly
				devises illnesses that get her returned home when she is sent away
				to school. Unlike her mother, Blanca is quite practical. After her
				divorce from Jean de Satigny, and even more so after Clara's death,
				Blanca runs the big house on the corner. Like both of her parents,
				Blanca is incredibly stubborn. Even while she runs his house, she
				never asks for a cent from her father, instead supporting herself
				through her ceramics.

Blanca's character is defined primarily by her love for
				Pedro Tercero. However, she is not simply attached to him. In fact,
				for most of the novel she is separated from Pedro Tercero as much
				by her own choice as by outside circumstance. It is precisely the
				idea of her love for Pedro Tercero that defines Blanca more than
				any actual relationship the two may have.
