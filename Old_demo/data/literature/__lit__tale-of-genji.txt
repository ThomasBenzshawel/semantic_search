The Tale of Genji by Lady Murasaki Shikibu is the world’s first famous novel. Written in the early eleventh century, this influential account of court life in Heian-era Japan follows the sparkling career of Prince Genji as he navigates love and loss. There are several translations of this important work, but this SparkNote relies on the first English-language translation, completed by Kenchō Suematsu in 1882. Although the original novel has fifty-four chapters, the Suematsu translation is abridged, containing only the first seventeen chapters, which are devoted to Prince Genji’s youth and early adulthood.
