Clara is barely aware of the material world. She is most
				interested in communicating with spirits and only pays attention
				to mundane details such as domestic chores in times of extreme necessity.
				Clara is often described as floating through the world. At times,
				this refers to her literally levitating, at others it shows the
				way she is able to ignore much of what she does not want to deal
				with. Clara's temper is extremely calm. She inspires great respect
				and devotion in all those who meet her, from Esteban to his sister
				Ferula to his foreman Pedro Segundo. Although she can see it in
				advance, Clara never fights her destiny. She is not, however, passive.
				When she faces a situation that she does not like, she proceeds
				to change it in quiet, subtle ways, such as adding little rooms
				to the big house on the corner bit by bit until, although it looks
				the same on the outside and is completely transformed. Clara's character
				changes very little as she grows from a young girl to an old woman.
