Upon their first meeting, Snow Flower is the type of person Lily wants to be. However, Snow Flower is eventually revealed to come from a formerly wealthy and now disgraced family. She keeps this a secret from Lily, knowing even her laotong would judge her for what her family has become. Although Snow Flower comes from noble ancestors, and has learned sophisticated manners, she cares for social class and tradition much less than Lily does. Instead of feeling ashamed of her family, as Lily assumes she would, Snow Flower mourns what happened to her parents, showing she feels love and empathy much more keenly than Lily does. Snow Flower also grieves the loss of her stillborn daughters, which is a mystery to Lily, who sees daughters as burdens.

Despite the impatience Lily shows toward Snow Flower as they grow older, Snow Flower deeply cherishes Lily’s friendship. Lily is the only person with whom Snow Flower can speak openly and honestly about her suffering, especially once Snow Flower gets married and experiences abuse from her husband and mother-in-law. However, Snow Flower is perceptive about Lily’s feelings toward her, and knows she must find friends who will listen to her instead of telling her what to do. Still, Snow Flower remains loyal to Lily by adhering to their laotong contract, never becoming a sworn sister with the other sisters herself. Even as Snow Flower is dying, she craves Lily’s company in spite of the fact that Lily publicly humiliated her with the Letter of Vituperation. In the end, Snow Flower’s life and death are what teach Lily what true love is.
