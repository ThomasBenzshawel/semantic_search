The War of the Worlds, by British author H.G. Wells, is a science fiction novel first published in a serialized version in 1897 and then in hardcover in 1898. It was an immediate success and since its initial publication the novel has never been out of print. Its unnamed Narrator is a man living in a London suburb who tells the story of a Martian invasion of England. In 1938, American director Orson Welles produced a radio broadcast based on the novel that some listeners interpreted as a real report, resulting in widespread panic. Two highly successful film adaptations of The War of the Worlds have been made—in 1953 and in 2005.
