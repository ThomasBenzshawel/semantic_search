When Anne arrives in Avonlea, she is a stray waif with
				a pitiable past, but she quickly establishes herself in Green Gables
				and the Avonlea community. She is not useful to Matthew and Marilla,
				her guardians, who wanted a boy orphan to help out on the farm.
				Still, Anne’s spirit brings vitality to the narrow, severe atmosphere
				at Green Gables. Her desire for beauty, imagination, and goodness motivates
				her behavior. Although some people, like Matthew, recognize Anne’s
				admirable qualities from the beginning, others misunderstand Anne
				and think her unorthodox behavior evidence of immorality. The very
				traits that make Anne unique and enrich her inner life also cause
				her to act passionately and stubbornly and to bungle chores. Reveries
				and daydreams constantly absorb her, taking up attention that Marilla
				feels should be spent thinking of decorum and duty.

	As a child, Anne loves and hates with equal fervor. She
				makes lifelong alliances with people she considers kindred spirits
				and holds years-long grudges against people who cross her. Anne’s
				terrible temper flares at minimal provocations, and she screams
				and stamps her foot when anger overtakes her. Anne lusts for riches
				and elegance. She despises her red hair and longs for smooth ivory
				skin and golden hair. She imagines that which displeases her as
				different than what it is, dreaming up a more perfect world. As
				she grows older, Anne mellows. Her temper improves, she ceases to
				hate her looks, she appreciates the simplicity of her life and prefers
				it to riches, and although her imagination still serves her well,
				she loves the world as it is.
