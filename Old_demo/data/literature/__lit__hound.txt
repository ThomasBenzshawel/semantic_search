The Hound of the Baskervilles is a detective novel written by Arthur Conan Doyle, first serialized in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902. The novel represented the return of the famous English detective Sherlock Holmes after Conan Doyle had attempted to kill him off in 1893 in the story “The Final Problem.” The author, who had wearied of being solely identified with his most famous creation, had spent the intervening years writing both fiction and nonfiction before finally bowing to the immense public pressures (and huge financial rewards) to revive Holmes.

It is one of the most famous and enduring works featuring the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The story is set in the moorlands of Devonshire, England, and follows Holmes and Dr. John Watson as they investigate the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the ominous legend of a supernatural hound that haunts the Baskerville family.

The Hound of the Baskervilles is situated at the turn of the 20th century, capturing the cultural and societal milieu of England at the close of the Victorian era. The novel reflects the fascination with detective fiction during this period and showcases Conan Doyle’s masterful storytelling and intricate plotting. The Hound of the Baskervilles has become a classic in the detective genre, known for its atmospheric setting, clever deductions by Sherlock Holmes, and the suspenseful unraveling of the mystery. The novel’s enduring popularity has led to numerous adaptations in various media, including film, television, and radio, the best known of which is probably the 1939 film version starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes.
