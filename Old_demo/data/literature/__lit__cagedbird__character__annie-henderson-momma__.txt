Maya and Bailey’s paternal grandmother, Momma raises them for most of their childhood. She owns the only store in the Black section of Stamps, Arkansas, and it serves as the central gathering place for the Black community. She has owned the store for about twenty-five years, starting it as a mobile lunch counter and eventually building the store in the heart of the Black community. Not knowing that Momma was Black , a judge once subpoenaed her as “Mrs. Henderson,” which cemented her elevated status in the mind of the Black community.

Similarly, Momma is the moral center of the family and especially of Maya’s life. Momma raises the children according to stern Christian values and strict rules. She is defined by an unshakable faith in God, her loyalty to her community, and a deep love for everything she touches. Despite the affection she feels for her grandchildren, she cares more about their well-being than her own needs, extracting them from the Stamps community when the racist pressures begin to affect Bailey negatively.

While in Stamps, Momma teaches Maya how to conduct herself around white people. She chooses her words, emotions, and battles carefully, especially when race plays a role. Momma considers herself a realist regarding race relations. She stands up for herself but believes that white people cannot be spoken to without risking one’s life. When three nasty poor white children mock Momma from the yard one afternoon, Maya watches furiously, but Momma maintains her dignity by not even acknowledging their taunts. Though stern and not given to emotional or affectionate displays, Momma conveys the depth of her love for Maya and Bailey throughout the book.
