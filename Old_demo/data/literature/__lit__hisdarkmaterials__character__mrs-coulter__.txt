Mrs. Coulter, Lyra’s mother, is an almost purely evil
				character. Despite her charming and persuasive demeanor, Mrs. Coulter
				is the greediest, most power-hungry character in the trilogy. Her
				daemon, a vicious little golden monkey, reflects its owner’s personality.
				Just as the monkey enjoys torturing and killing bats in the cave
				in which Mrs. Coulter keeps Lyra, Mrs. Coulter enjoys toying with
				people before she kills them. She shows no remorse after tearing
				people to pieces or torturing them to death. For much of the trilogy,
				Mrs. Coulter is associated with the Church, where she heads up the
				General Oblation Board, the organization that kidnaps children in order
				to perform dastardly experiments on them. 

Despite her cruelty, Mrs. Coulter has a soft spot for
				Lyra. She rescues Lyra from Intercision at Bolvanger, she looks
				after Lyra in the cave in the Himalayas, and she fights desperately
				with Father MacPhail to make sure that his bomb doesn’t kill Lyra.
				In the end, she gives her own life to drag Metatron into the abyss
				so that Lyra can accomplish her goal. Mrs. Coulter’s transformation
				is inspired by Lyra, who evokes extraordinary love from most people
				she encounters.

Mrs. Coulter’s relationship with Lord Asriel, Lyra’s father,
				adds another dimension to her character. The struggle between Mrs. Coulter
				and Lord Asriel drives much of the trilogy’s narrative. Though Mrs.
				Coulter and Lord Asriel battle for control of their daughter, Lyra’s
				existence suggests that a powerful attraction once existed between
				them.
