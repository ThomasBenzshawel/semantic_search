Published in 1928, Nella Larsenâ€™s Quicksand attracted literary acclaim during the early years of the Harlem Renaissance. The novel was critically successful and earned the author a Harmon Foundation Bronze Award for literature, making Larsen into a public figure in Harlem. While Quicksand fell out of popularity as the Harlem Renaissance ended, scholars revived interest in the novel in the late 20th century, and it is now considered one of the central literary works of that cultural movement.
