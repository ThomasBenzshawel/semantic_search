The Trenors are another socialite couple who often host
large events at their home, Bellomont. Mrs. Trenor is a gossip and
spends much of her day fretting over the minutiae of entertaining—which
guests are the most desirable to invite, which have been “stolen”
by another conflicting event, and which unmarried men and
women should be set up together. Gus Trenor looks to other
women for the attention his wife doesn’t give him. A notorious flirt,
Gus is drawn to Lily, and he uses his financial investment skills
and a large sum of his own money in a risky investment for Lily.
This money becomes the focal point of the second half of the novel,
as Lily commits herself to repaying her debt.
