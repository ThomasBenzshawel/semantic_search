Lidia is Mateo’s best friend and the mother of his goddaughter, Penny. Lidia has experienced more hardship and grief than most people her age, but she is still vibrant and optimistic. However, the grief of her boyfriend’s death, coupled with becoming a single, teenage mother, have damaged Lidia’s self-esteem. Lidia frequently disparages her own looks and her ability to cope with motherhood, but through Mateo’s eyes, it is clear she is strong, loving, and selfless. Mateo’s perception of Lidia is presented as a metaphor for the keen ability loved ones have for seeing each other’s best qualities when it is difficult for a person to see those qualities on their own. In turn, Lidia reciprocates Mateo’s love by pursuing him on his End Day even when he hides it from her, proving she understands the importance of being present for friends and family at their most vulnerable moments. When Lidia meets Mateo at The Travel Arena, it reveals that Lidia’s past has taught her it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.
