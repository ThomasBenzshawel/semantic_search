The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates is a biography and autobiography first published in 2010. It contrast the life of its author, Wes Moore—a Rhodes Scholar, Army veteran, and former CEO of the poverty-fighting Robinhood Foundation—with the dramatically different experiences of another man of the same name. Also born in Baltimore, the other Wes Moore is serving a life sentence in prison. The Other Wes Moore offers a street-level view of urban American poverty in the 1980s through the early 2000s.
