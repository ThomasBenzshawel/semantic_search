In rehab, Blue initially exhibits a caustic bitterness that suggests she accepts her fate as a hopeless social outcast, but this hard persona belies her emotional intelligence. When she needles Charlie to speak, she recognizes that the two of them have a lot in common, a fact that she confirms when she steals Charlie’s paper and reads about how she feels right before cutting. Blue and Charlie build a friendship over email, and by the time Blue arrives in Tucson, she no longer needs to play the role of the mean girl, a persona she seemed to relish at the rehab center. Her defiant optimism and openness allow her to make friends easily and feel confident despite her scars. But part of that optimism comes from the alcoholic fog she maintains, dulling her sensibilities and preventing herself from making a full recovery. Charlie finds Blue to be both intimidating and inspirational, self-accepting and self-defeating. When Louisa sets herself on fire, Blue and Charlie relapse together, but after separate periods of recovery, they reunite and pledge to do better. As a sole survivor of a similar catastrophe to Charlie’s, Blue becomes like a sister to her and the two hold each other accountable and comfort each other in their moments of doubt and pain.
