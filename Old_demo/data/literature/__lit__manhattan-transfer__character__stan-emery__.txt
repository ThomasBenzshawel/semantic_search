Stan exemplifies a theme of self-destruction that runs through the novel. He has every opportunity available to him, yet he cannot help but sabotage himself. Drunk in most of his vignettes, Stan has grown up wealthy, is used to opulent surroundings, and does not have to work hard to get what he needs. Like Ellen, he loves the materialism and consumerism of the city. Things seem to come easy to him because he comes from money and is clever and fast-talking, but these qualities only get him so far, and his alcohol addiction begins to take complete control of his life. Because everything has been handed to him, he does not know how to work hard for something. When he falls in love with Ellen, he is on the cusp of a real future, but he cannot control his impulses long enough to build a healthy relationship. After so many instances of Stan’s over the top drunken behavior, the events of Chapter XII do not seem out of the ordinary until Stan sits on the waterfront looking at the skyline. His potential as an architect is referenced, and the chapter’s tone veers into darkness. When he returns to his apartment Stan stumbles around his kitchen, and the furniture is described as moving on its own as if it is not Stan throwing it around. This language has the effect of taking responsibility away from Stan, and it is as if he just happens to be there. Stan ends the chapter with a final act of self-destruction by killing himself in a fire.
