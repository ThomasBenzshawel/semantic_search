Rose Hsu Jordan finds herself unable to assert her opinion,
				to stand up for herself, or to make decisions. Although she once
				displayed a certain strength, illustrated by her insistence on marrying
				her husband, Ted, despite her mother’s objections and her mother-in-law’s poorly
				concealed racism, she has allowed herself to become the “victim”
				to Ted’s “hero,” letting him make all of the decisions in their
				life together. She finally needs her mother’s intervention in order
				to realize that to refuse to make decisions is in fact itself a
				decision: a decision to continue in a state of subservience, inferiority, and
				ultimate unhappiness.

Rose’s youngest brother, Bing, died when he was four years
				old. Because Bing drowned at the beach while Rose was supposed to
				be watching him, Rose feels responsible for his death, despite the
				fact that the rest of the family does not hold Rose accountable.
				Her refusal to take on future responsibilities may stem from her
				fear of future blame should misfortunes occur.
