The Hiding Place is a nonfiction memoir about Corrie ten Boom’s experiences in World War II. A bestseller after its publication in 1971, it tells the story of how ten Boom and her sister, two unmarried women in their 50s, became involved with the Dutch underground during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The authors vividly capture the members of the ten Boom family, their friends, the people they helped, and the Germans they encountered during and after the war. The narrative, told in Corrie ten Boom’s voice, is heavily informed by her Christian faith and that of her co-authors, John and Elizabeth Sherrill.
