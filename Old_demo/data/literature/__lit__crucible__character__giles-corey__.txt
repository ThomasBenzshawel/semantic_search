Giles is a noble character in the play. He represents strength of will to the other characters, who end up looking up to him or feeling cowed by him, depending on how they have acted themselves. Early on the play, Giles sees the possibility of witchcraft in town as intriguing, and he asks Rev. Hale why his wife seems to be able to stop him from reading just by being in the room. But by the middle of the play, when his wife has been arrested for witchcraft, Giles realizes his mistake and joins John in approaching the court to tell Danforth he’s wrong. Giles is also smart enough to realize that Putnam is using the accusations of witchcraft as cover to try to take back property they’ve fought over for many years. He refuses to confess to witchcraft, even when he is tortured. In a town where many people lie to save their own skins, and accuse their neighbors rather than speak up for what is right, Giles stands apart as a truly noble and brave man.
