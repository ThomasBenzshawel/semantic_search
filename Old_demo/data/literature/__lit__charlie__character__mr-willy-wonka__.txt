The eccentric owner of the world-famous Wonka chocolate
				factory. Along with his eccentric behavior, Mr. Wonka also has a
				benevolent side. The mystery workers operating his chocolate factory
				after the reopening are called Oompa-Loompas. The Oompa-Loompas
				hail from Loompaland, where they are the defenseless prey of hungry creatures
				like hornswogglers, snozzwangers, and whandoodles until Mr. Wonka
				rescues them. He brings the malnourished Oompa-Loompas back to his
				factory where they are allowed to eat their favorite food—cacao
				beans—in unlimited quantities and live in complete safety in exchange
				for running the factory. Mr. Wonka treats the Oompa-Loompas like
				children, and, in return, they treat him as a benevolent caretaker.
				Mr. Wonka further demonstrates his affinity for children and wariness
				of adults by choosing a child to take over his factory. The child
				he seeks is humble, respectful, and willing to run his factory exactly
				how Mr. Wonka runs it himself.

Though benevolent, Mr. Wonka’s character is not beyond reproach.
				His treatment of the Oompa-Loompas is paternalistic, and his desire
				to mold a child into a second version of himself is narcissistic.
				Furthermore, Mr. Wonka is unwilling to accept anyone’s foibles.
				He can be extremely demanding and judgmental. The four children
				who do not win the grand prize clearly disgust Mr. Wonka. He is
				short with each of them—he acts as if he invited each of them simply
				to prove the virtuosity of Charlie. The humble and gracious Charlie
				is everything Mr. Wonka is looking for.
