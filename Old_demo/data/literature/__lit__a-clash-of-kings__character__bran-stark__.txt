A terrible fall in Game of Thrones crushed Bran Stark’s dreams of becoming a knight. Without the use of his legs, Bran must rely on Hodor and others to move around. He feels much shame and frustration about his situation, but he knows that he must set his feelings and old ambitions behind in order to supervise Winterfell in Robb’s absence. Bran displays an ability to inhabit the body of his direwolf, Summer. Confused about these dreams, he does not want to face the truth about himself, that he is a warg. Jojen Reed encourages him to accept his true nature, but for much the novel Bran wars against himself, doubting whether Jojen is right. His ultimate embrace of his identity shows Bran’s growing maturity and his recognition that losing the use of his legs has not stripped him of his worth.
