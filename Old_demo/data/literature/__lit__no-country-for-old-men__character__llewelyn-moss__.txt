Moss, thirty-six, is a self-sufficient, stubborn Vietnam veteran. He is a blue-collar worker, holding down a job as a welder and occupying a trailer with his young wife. The promise of the easier life the drug money could bring him motivates him to steal it. This weakness proves fateful, as does the compassionate decision he makes to return to the scene of the shootout to bring water to the man who was still alive. 

Once the bad guys know his identity, Moss goes on the run and sends his wife away for her protection. He displays ingenuity in hiding the money and evading capture despite being shot. As a former sniper, he is comfortable around guns but has little desire to kill again, though he believes he will have to do so. However, when he has Chigurh in his clutches, he gives up the chance to kill him and eliminate at least one of his pursuers. He has so much faith in his ability to survive that he refuses Wells’ initial offer of help and later Chigurh’s offer to spare Carla Jean’s life in return for the money. 

Readers see another side of Moss through his conversations with the hitchhiker. While he flirts and jokes with her, he always remains loyal to his wife, spurning the teenager’s numerous sexual advances. Moss’s manner of death—trying to save the teenage hitchhiker held by the hitman—also demonstrates his chivalrous nature. Instead of remaining cool and figuring a way out of the situation, he charges out of the room with no plan and ends up getting shot. Moss dies with few people understanding his true nature.
