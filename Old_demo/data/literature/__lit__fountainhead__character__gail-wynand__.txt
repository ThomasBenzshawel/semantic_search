The charismatic, capable, and aristocratic Wynand straddles
				the line between mainstream society and Roark’s world, and this
				division makes him the novel’s tragic figure. Like Roark, Wynand
				has extraordinary capabilities and energy, but unlike Roark he lets
				the world corrupt him. When we first meet Wynand, he is entirely
				a man of the outside world, exclusively involved with society and
				its interests. His youthful idealism has been crushed by the world’s
				cynicism. Wynand makes his living with newspapers that report on
				the vulgar and the common. This involvement with the world leaves Wynand
				misanthropic, bored, and suicidal. Wynand’s worldview changes when
				he meets Dominique and Roark, who ignite the passion and integrity
				lingering within Wynand. During Roark’s trial Wynand fights the
				world again and tries to turn his life around. He eventually feels
				that he cannot escape the ugliness he has created. Tragically, Wynand
				compromises at the last minute and loses his last chance at salvation.
