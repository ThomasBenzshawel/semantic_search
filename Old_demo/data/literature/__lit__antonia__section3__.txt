If I live here, like you, that is different.
					Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.

On the second morning of the blizzard, Jim wakes to a
					great commotion. When he arrives in the kitchen, his grandfather
					informs him that Mr. Shimerda is dead. With Ambrosch Shimerda curled
					up on a nearby bench, the Burdens quietly discuss the apparent suicide
					as they eat breakfast. Jake describes Krajiek’s strange behavior
					around the body and notes that Krajiek’s axe fits the gash in Mr.
					Shimerda’s face. Otto Fuchs and Mrs. Burden talk him out of his
					suspicions. After the meal, Otto sets out to summon the priest and
					the coroner from Black Hawk, and the others clear the road for the
					trip to the Shimerdas. Jim stays behind and finds himself alone.
					After completing a few chores, he settles down to contemplate Mr.
					Shimerda’s death. At dusk, the wagon returns, and Jake describes
					the scene at the Shimerdas’ to Jim.

The next day, Otto returns from Black Hawk with a young
					Bohemian named Anton Jelinek. At dinner, Jelinek bemoans the fact
					that no priest could be found to put Mr. Shimerda to rest. Afterward, Jelinek
					goes out to clear a road to the Shimerdas’ wide enough for a wagon,
					and Otto begins to construct a coffin. Later in the afternoon, a
					number of other locals stop at the Burdens’ to ask after the Shimerdas
					and discuss the tragedy. The coroner refrains from issuing a warrant
					for Krajiek at Mr. Burden’s urging. The postmaster alerts the Burdens
					that none of the graveyards in the area will accept Mr. Shimerda
					because he killed himself, and Mrs. Burden lashes out in bitterness
					at this unfairness. With no graveyard to turn to, the Shimerdas
					decide that they will bury Mr. Shimerda on the corner of their homestead.

After lying dead in the barn for four days, Mr. Shimerda
					is finally buried on his own land. Despite the beginnings of another
					ominous snowfall, rural neighbors come from miles around to attend
					the burial. At Mrs. Shimerda’s request, Mr. Burden says a prayer
					in English for Mr. Shimerda, and afterward Otto leads the assembled group
					in a hymn.

With the coming of spring, the neighbors help the Shimerdas
					to build a new log house on their property, and they eventually
					acquire a new windmill and some livestock. One day, after giving
					an English lesson to Yulka, Jim asks Ántonia if she would like to
					attend the upcoming term at the schoolhouse. Ántonia proudly refuses,
					saying that she is kept too busy by farm work, but her tears of
					sorrow reveal her true feelings on the matter. Jim stays at the
					Shimerdas’ for supper, but he is offended by their ingratitude over
					neighborly charity and by Ántonia’s coarse manners.

Once school starts, Jim sees less and less of Ántonia,
					and soon tension erupts between them. When Jake and Jim ride over
					to the Shimerdas’ to collect a loaned horse collar, Ambrosch first
					denies borrowing it, then returns with a badly damaged collar he
					rudely gives over to them. After a heated exchange, Jake grabs Ambrosch, who
					kicks him in the stomach. Jake then pounds Ambrosch on the head.
					Jake and Jim quickly pull away from the Shimerdas’, as Mrs. Shimerda
					yells after them about sending for the authorities.

When Mr. Burden learns of the incident, he sends Jake
					into town with a ten-dollar bill to pay the assault fine. For the
					next few weeks, the Shimerdas are proud and aloof when meeting the
					Burdens in passing, although they maintain their respect for Mr.
					Burden. Finally Mr. Burden arranges a reconciliation by hiring Ambrosch
					to help with his wheat threshing and offering Ántonia a job to help Mrs.
					Burden in the kitchen. In addition, he forgives Mrs. Shimerda her
					debt on the milk cow she bought from him. In an effort to show her
					own forgiveness, Mrs. Shimerda knits Jake a pair of socks.

In high summer, Ántonia and Jim spend more time together,
					walking to the garden each morning to collect vegetables for dinner.
					One night, during an electric storm in a light rain, Ántonia and
					Jim climb onto the roof of the chicken house to stare at the sky
					until they are called down for supper. Ántonia tells Jim that things
					will be easy for him but hard for her family.

Throughout the novel, Jim shows an extraordinary capacity
					to identify with others, and, upon hearing of Mr. Shimerda’s apparent
					suicide, he immediately senses that “it was homesickness that had killed
					Mr. Shimerda.” As Jim imagines the homeward route of Mr. Shimerda’s
					released spirit through Chicago and Virginia, two way stations on
					his own journey to Nebraska, he identifies with the sense of loss
					that he believes caused Mr. Shimerda such disenchantment. In meditating
					on Mr. Shimerda’s life, Jim comes to feel as though his memories
					almost “might have been Mr. Shimerda’s memories.”

Jim’s most concentrated struggle with cultural difference
					occurs over the matter of religion. As Jake describes Ambrosch’s
					view that his father has been sent to purgatory as a result of his
					suicide, Jim rails against what is to him an incomprehensible stance,
					saying, “I almost know it isn’t true.” But the “almost” indicates
					Jim’s hesitation. Because he himself holds a belief that is mystical
					(his belief in the presence of Mr. Shimerda’s soul), Jim is unable
					to rule out the seemingly unsupportable beliefs of others. As he
					attempts to sleep that night, Jim is crushingly preoccupied with
					this unfamiliar idea of purgatory, suggesting that his confrontation
					with other ways of thinking has left him uncomfortable. Although
					Jim listens carefully to Anton Jelinek’s story of religious conviction
					and finds it “impossible not to admire his frank, manly faith,”
					there is clearly a divide between the Bohemians’ more instinctual
					faith and Jim’s more philosophical spirituality.

The Nebraska prairie, as an amalgam of various immigrant groups,
					is a testing ground for collisions between such differing religious
					viewpoints. Mr. Shimerda’s suicide proves to be a test case for the
					solidarity of the farming community. When the old-guard religions
					universally refuse to have a suicide buried in their graveyards, the
					Shimerdas are forced to come up with an alternative. In dismis-sing
					the conservative standards of the foreign churches, Mrs. Burden
					proposes “an American graveyard that will be more liberal minded.”
					This American graveyard is a burial plot on the family land, accompanied
					by a makeshift funeral and an improvised service conducted by the
					farming community. For all of its unorthodoxy, the beauty of this
					service captures Jim’s imagination, as he remarks on his affection
					for “the dim superstition” of the event and the “propitiatory intent”
					of the grave that remains behind it.

With Mr. Shimerda departed, the different paths that await Ántonia
					and Jim begin to emerge. Structurally, this chapter concludes Book I,
					the main phase of Jim and Ántonia’s relationship in the rural countryside.
					The directions that they will take in life are already becoming
					visible, and they begin to grow apart. Thrown into a more laborious
					role on the farm, Ántonia quickly loses her feminine softness, and
					Jim’s entry into school sets him off on an altogether separate road.
					Interestingly, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his more formal
					education, Jim fails to recognize the reality of this difference.
					When he says to Ántonia that he wishes she could always be “nice”
					rather than rough and tumble, she explains that “things will be
					easy for you. But they will be hard for us.” Here, for the first
					time, Cather clearly presents the dichotomy between Ántonia’s role
					as a rural worker and Jim’s role as a leisured thinker—a dichotomy
					that she explores throughout the remainder of the novel.
