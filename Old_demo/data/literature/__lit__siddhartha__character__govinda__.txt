Siddhartha’s best friend, Govinda, is also an earnest
				spiritual pilgrim but does not question teachings to the same extent
				Siddhartha does. For example, though Govinda is excited at the chance
				to follow Gotama, Siddhartha goes along but says he has lost his
				faith in teachers. When Siddhartha decides to leave Gotama’s side,
				Govinda instead remains stalwartly committed. Govinda does not choose
				his own path but follows the suggestions of others. Similarly, when
				the two old friends meet in the end, Govinda quickly apprentices
				himself to Siddhartha because Siddhartha has attained the Nirvana
				they both seek. The significant difference between Govinda and Siddhartha
				is that Govinda is primarily a follower, whereas Siddhartha is
				more inclined to strike out on his own path. This difference is one
				of the reasons Siddhartha is eventually able to achieve enlightenment
				through his own efforts, while Govinda needs assistance in order
				to achieve the same state. Siddhartha is better able to see the
				truth before him because of his self-reliance. Govinda needs others
				to point out the wisdom he should follow and is unable to see when
				he is following a flawed path and, ultimately, when he is nearing
				enlightenment.

At the beginning of their quest, when Govinda
				joins the Samanas, he may well have gone along simply to be with
				his friend. However, the severity and austere nature of their new
				lifestyle leaves little reason to doubt Govinda’s conviction. He
				may be more of a follower than Siddhartha is, but his conviction
				and determination to find enlightenment are still strong. He does, after
				all, eventually find enlightenment, just as Siddhartha does—he just
				arrives at it in a different way.
