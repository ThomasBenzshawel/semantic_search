Like his wife, Elihu Lockton is a tyrant and a mercenary who cares more about money than integrity. He is violent with Madam, hitting and bruising her when they disagree. He is a coward who flees the city twice in the novel to protect himself, putting his wife Madam, aunt Lady Clarissa Seymour, and his household at risk. Like Madam, Lockton is a liar who has no trouble bending the truth to protect his own interests.

At times, Lockton is not as overtly cruel as Madam, but that is simply because he prefers peace, not because he seeks justice. For example, Lockton first insists that Ruth can stay, but this insistence is simply to keep Isabel calm. He usually gives in to Madam’s whims just to keep her quiet.

Lockton is a static character. He represents the European aristocratic merchant who cares for only himself and his own interests. He is loyal to the monarchy because it serves him, not out of love or respect. In fact, Lockton doesn’t truly respect anyone but himself.
