Frank Frink worked for Wyndam-Matson’s metalworking company for several years making forgeries of antiques. When he becomes frustrated with his job, he knows that if he speaks out, he might get fired. Frink is Jewish, so his options are limited. He’s safest on the West coast, which is controlled by the Japanese, and he’ll be captured and killed if he returns to the German-occupied East coast. Frink decides to speak out anyway and is encouraged by his co-worker, Ed McCarthy, who recognizes Frink’s talents. Now that he’s been fired, he can create something new. 

Frink frequently dreams about his ex-wife, Juliana, and consults the I Ching when he needs to decide on something. He’s a character that both takes action and remains passive to his fate. Frink makes calculated risks based on his passive reception of I Ching’s advice, which predicts that his new venture will have mixed results. He’s a character of both dreams and hard work, and the result is his being able to create something new with his jewelry. Ironically, Frink creates something original by using the skills he developed to make forgeries. It’s not clear whether Frink will gain financially from his jewelry, but his life seems to be protected by the universe. He manages to stay on his path regardless of the people, events, and situations around him, through his dedication to the I Ching.
