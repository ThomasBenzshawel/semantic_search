Philip Lombard has the most mysterious past of anyone
				on the island. He is a world traveler and a former military man
				who seems to have served as a soldier of fortune in Africa. In the
				epilogue, one of the policemen describes him as having “been mixed
				up in some very curious shows abroad . . . [the] sort of fellow
				who might do several murders in some quiet out-of-the-way spot.”
				He comes to Indian Island after Isaac Morris hires him, supposedly
				because Mr. Owen needs a “good man in a tight spot.” Clearly a dangerous
				man, Lombard carries a gun and is frequently described as moving
				“like a panther.” He is bold enough to initiate several searches
				of the island, perceptive enough to suspect Judge Wargrave of being
				the killer, and brave enough to voice his suspicions. Lombard is
				also honest: he owns up to his past misdeeds. When the recorded
				voice accuses him of leaving twenty-one men from an East African
				tribe to die in the bush, Lombard cheerfully admits to it, saying
				there was only enough food for himself and a friend, and so they
				took off with it. The other characters cannot bring themselves to
				admit their own guilt, but Lombard has no such qualms.

	Lombard does display a weakness, however, that ultimately brings
				about his downfall: his chivalrous and old-fashioned attitude toward
				women. In the first group conversation about the murders, he suggests
				excluding the women from the list of potential suspects, since he
				considers them incapable of homicidal behavior. Lombard’s tendency
				to underestimate women enables Vera to steal his gun and shoot him
				when he jumps at her. In a strange way, his death unites Vera and
				Lombard—they are the only characters to die at the hand of someone
				other than Wargrave.
