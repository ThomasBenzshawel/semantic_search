Christopher’s father often goes to extremes when demonstrating his emotions,
				occasionally blowing up in anger, and he lacks the confidence to work through his
				problems verbally. When trying to explain himself he stutters and stops and often
				has trouble connecting sentences. Like Christopher, he has very few friends—Rhodri
				is the only one the novel mentions. He also feels emotionally devastated by the way
				his relationship with his wife (Christopher’s mother) ended two years earlier, and
				because he has no one to help him cope with his emotions, he bottles them up until
				he explodes in anger during stressful situations.

Christopher’s father lovingly and diligently cares for Christopher, yet he
				also struggles with the frustration he feels as a result of not always being able to
				understand Christopher’s behavior. He carefully prepares all of Christopher’s meals
				according to Christopher’s rigid list of likes and dislikes, but he also becomes
				angry with Christopher when Christopher misunderstands him. Notably, he is extremely
				protective of Christopher. This impulse to protect Christopher and his desire to
				punish Christopher’s mother for the way she left leads him to lie to Christopher
				about mother’s leaving. As Christopher discovers more and more of the truth about
				his mother, Christopher’s father can see his relationship with Christopher
				deteriorating. Christopher’s father must work to regain Christopher’s trust, and the
				novel’s final chapters focus on his efforts to reestablish a relationship with
				Christopher.
