A quiet, peaceful, nature-loving boy, Leper shocks his
				classmates by becoming the first boy at Devon to enlist in the army;
				he shocks them again by deserting soon after. Both of Leper’s decisions
				demonstrate important properties of the war: to the students at
				Devon, it constitutes a great unknown, overshadowing their high
				school years and rendering their actions mere preparations for a
				dark future. Leper’s decision to enlist stems from his inability
				to bear the prolonged waiting period, his desire simply to initiate
				what he knows to be inevitable. Later, his desertion of the army
				again demonstrates a horrible truth: despite their years of expectation,
				the boys can never really be ready to face the atrocities of war.

Leper’s descriptions of his wartime hallucinations constitute
				one of the novel’s darkest moments. He proceeds to outline to Gene, with
				terrifying detail, the hallucinations that he suffered in the army, disproving
				Gene’s belief that he, Leper, cannot possibly descend into bitterness
				or angry flashbacks when walking through his beloved, beautiful
				outdoors. This tension emphasizes the contrast between the loveliness
				of the natural world and the hideousness of the characters’ inner
				lives. Most of Leper’s visions involve transformations of some kind,
				such as men turning into women and the arms of chairs turning into
				human arms. In a sense, then, Leper’s hallucinations reflect the
				fears and angst of adolescence, in which the transformation of boys
				into men—and, in wartime, of boys into soldiers—causes anxiety and
				inner turmoil.
