Highly intelligent, perceptive, and inquisitive, Nyasha is old beyond her
				years. Like the other female characters in Nervous Conditions,
				she is complex and multifaceted, and her dual nature reflects her status as the
				product of two worlds, Africa and England. On one hand she is emotional,
				passionate, and provocative, while on the other she is rational and profound in
				her thinking. Nyasha is admired by Tambu for her ability to see conflict and
				disagreement not as threats but as opportunities to increase her understanding
				of herself and the world. She uses the various experiences life presents her
				with as a chance to grow, learn, and improve. Initially, she thrives in her
				state of unresolved and often warring emotions and feelings, and she sees any
				inconsistencies in her feelings or her world as opportunities for greater
				self-development.

Nyasha’s precocious nature and volatile, ungrounded identity eventually
				take their toll, and isolation and loneliness are her reward for being
				unconventional and fiercely independent. She is unpopular at the mission school,
				but this unpopularity is due more to her willfulness than the fact she is the
				headmaster’s daughter. Her inner resources and resolve are highly developed, but
				they can sustain her only so far. Over the course of the novel, the elements
				that define her and the aspects of her personality she most cherishes become the
				source of her unrest and ultimate breakdown. Nyasha begins to resent her
				outspoken nature and the constant spirit of resistance she displays,
				particularly to her father. The transformation leads to self-hatred, a
				dangerously negative body image that results in an eating disorder, and mental
				illness. Nyasha becomes a symbolic victim of the pressures to embrace modernity,
				change, enlightenment, and self-improvement.
