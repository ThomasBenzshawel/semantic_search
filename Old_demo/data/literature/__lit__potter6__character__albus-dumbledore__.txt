The name Albus is the Latin word for white, which suits
				Albus Dumbledore perfectly. Not only is his long trademark beard
				a snowy white, Dumbledore is also a good wizard, wholly committed to
				white magic, standing firmly against the Dark Arts. As headmaster
				of Hogwarts, Dumbledore is openly dedicated to using his powers
				to serve the greater good. Consequently, Dumbledore is self-sacrificing
				and benevolent, ready to risk his own life to preserve the happiness
				of others. When Harry and Dumbledore reach what they believe to
				be Merope’s locket, Dumbledore insists that Harry pour the entire
				basin of potion down his throat, no matter how much he may protest.
				Likewise, at the close of the novel, Rowling leaves the possibility
				open that Dumbledore has, in fact, insisted that Snape murder him
				to save Draco from becoming a killer.

Dumbledore appreciates Harry’s strong, unwavering heart
				and often lets Harry get away with things he might discipline other
				students for. Unsurprisingly, Dumbledore was offered and refused
				the position of Minister of Magic three times, because he prefers
				to work at Hogwarts and is clearly not enticed by promises of empty power.
				Unlike most members of the Wizarding community, Dumbledore will
				freely speak Lord Voldemort’s name. When Dumbledore is killed by
				Snape, his funeral is attended by students, teachers, Ministry officials,
				giants, merpeople, and various other human and nonhuman mourners.
				The diversity of the crowd speaks to Dumbledore’s welcoming, nonjudgmental
				nature.
