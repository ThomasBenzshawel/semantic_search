The protagonist of the novel, Lily Bart, is a beautiful
young woman searching for the right husband who will give her the
money and status to remain in upper-class New York social circles.
While she has a streak of the romantic in her, her primary focus
is on the wealth and social status of potential suitors, and she
casts aside many options, believing she can do better. The novel
follows a two-year period in Lily’s life as she moves from party
to party, struggling to stay within the favor of the wealthy while
mounting larger and larger debts. Unfortunately, her precarious
financial situation forces her to try some risky investing with
the help of a married man, which ends up backfiring and resulting
in her being cast out of the circles she so desperately wishes to
join. When her family rejects her for the same untrue rumors, Lily
is forced to join the middle class, working as a hat maker. Her
slide into poverty and depression continues, and eventually, Lily
takes too large a dose of sleeping medication—perhaps accidentally—and
dies in her sleep. Her focus on financial success never allows her
to truly consider a marriage to Selden, her truest friend and most
ideal match.
