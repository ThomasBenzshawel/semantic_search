Wilhelm is Werther’s best friend and faithful correspondent who clearly loves Werther and cares deeply about his welfare. Wilhelm is a practical and sensible foil to Werther, and his continued correspondence with Werther suggests that he is rational enough to see through Werther’s many emotional outpourings. Werther’s tendency to withhold important information from Wilhelm gives further testament to Wilhelm’s ability to guess what Werther might do, and that he will not hesitate to set Werther on a better path.
