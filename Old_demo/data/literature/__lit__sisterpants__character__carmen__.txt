The daughter of divorced parents, Carmen has always depended
				on her mother, Christina, and her three best friends to be her family. Although
				she loves her father, Albert, her relationship with him is fragile,
				and Carmen is afraid to be honest with him about how she feels,
				fearing that any conflict will drive him away. She’s proud of her
				Puerto Rican side, as well as her curvy body, but spending the summer
				with Albert’s new family makes her feel like an outsider. Lydia,
				Krista, and Paul are all very white and blond, and Carmen stands
				out with her dark skin and full figure. Terrified of telling Albert
				how hurt she is that he has replaced her and Christina with a new
				family, she instead acts rude and difficult, almost daring the new
				family to dislike her. When she throws a rock through the kitchen
				window while the family is eating dinner, she is making a desperate
				attempt to communicate all the things she stubbornly denies feeling:
				hurt, betrayal, anger, and shame. These childish acts of defiance
				make Carmen feel bad about herself, and she often wishes she could
				act less like a brat and more like a mature adult.

Loving and devoted to her friends, Carmen is the most
				introspective of the four girls, always struggling to figure out
				where she fits, what she feels, and how to strengthen the girls’
				friendship so that it lasts forever. She is the voice that begins
				and ends the novel, explaining the girls’ history of being friends
				and telling readers about how the Pants came into their lives. Although
				all the girls value their friendship, Carmen is the girl who is
				most aware of how fragile friendship can be, especially during the
				growing-up years when boys, college, and separation are on the horizon.
				Because she understands the preciousness of their friendship, she
				leads readers into the story and helps us understand that preciousness
				too.
