They Both Die at the End is a 2017 contemporary young-adult fiction novel written by Adam Silvera. Set in 2017, a new technology makes it possible for people to be alerted on the day of their death. Two boys, Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio, get their notifications from Death-Cast within minutes of each other. Although they begin their End Day as strangers, they become Last Friends and set out to pack as much living as possible into one day. What they find together is so much more than they expected as they face their fears, process their pain, and fall in love, all in less than twenty-four hours.
