Rab is two years older than Johnny, and when they first
				meet, he is everything that Johnny is not. Rab’s quiet confidence
				and sense of self makes him a foil for Johnny, who is still uncertain
				of his role in the world. Rab is quiet where Johnny is talkative,
				unassuming where Johnny is proud, and patient where Johnny is impetuous. From
				their very first meeting, Johnny sees Rab as a model and the man
				that he wants to become. Nonjudgmental and open-minded, Rab is immediately
				able to see through Johnny’s brash exterior to his sincere and lonely
				inner self. Rab reaches out to him effectively, providing him with
				a new life. He does not pity Johnny for his crippled hand and lost
				job. Instead, he offers Johnny the opportunity to overcome his handicaps.

	Although Rab is only sixteen years old, he seems to feel
				comfortable in the world of high politics. He is trusted by all
				of the most important Revolutionary War leaders, who rely on him
				to print the Whig paper called the Boston Observer. Rab
				appears introverted and unflappable, but he harbors strong passions
				just below the surface. A devoted patriot and ideologue,
				Rab is a born fighter. He is fearless and thrives during times of
				strife because he is passionate and believes deeply in human rights.
				As soon as militias begin to form to fight against the British government,
				Rab joins the Minute Men. Forbes suggests that just as Rab makes
				an ardent fighter, he could also make an ardent lover. One of the
				only two times that Johnny sees Rab animated is during a party at
				which Rab dances with every girl present, and Rab’s secret courtship
				of Cilla hints at deep, passionate feelings. Rab is never given
				the chance to explore his second passion, though, as he is killed
				fulfilling his first. He is fatally shot at Lexington, during the
				opening battle of the Revolutionary War.
