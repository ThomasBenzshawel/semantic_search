Like his friends and family, Titus has been hardwired into the feed since birth, which has blocked his ability to think, feel, or question anything. Titus praises corporations who control School™, for example, for their “investment in tomorrow,” a line he’s likely been fed his whole life. Along with everyone else in his bubble, Titus is also motivated solely by superficial pursuits such as partying and consuming. What is more, his dependence on the feed, coupled with his family’s wealth, lead him not only to live an entitled life, but also one of ignorance. 

Titus begins to change once he meets Violet and they are hacked while on the moon, however. Through Violet, he learns about the feed’s flaws and that the Earth is dead. He sees further evidence of this when the Coalition of Pity hacks into his dreams, showing him images of ecological decay and human suffering. Despite his growing awareness, though, Titus finds it difficult to overcome his feed-induced apathy. He opts to go back to sleep after seeing the images, and as Violet’s condition worsens, grows increasingly distant and discards her. Still, it can be argued that Titus redeems himself in the novel’s final chapter. As Violet lies on a floating bed, seemingly dead, he tells her a story, he says, so she’ll remember herself. His wording may feel like a clichéd feedcast. But as its specifics emerge, Titus, it seems, finally opens his own eyes, acknowledges the dire state of the world, and learns how to be human.
