Daisy grew up believing that she was an ordinary Canadian girl. She had a supportive, if somewhat distant, relationship with her parents. Soon after she decided, against her parents’ wishes, to attend a rally against Gilead’s human rights violations, Daisy’s world fell apart and forced her to undergo a series of rapid transformations, from disenchanted orphan to reluctant revolutionary to hero. When her parents were suddenly murdered, a group of Mayday operatives working to take Gilead down informed her that her parents were, in fact, not her parents and that she was “Baby Nicole,” a child that had attained legendary status after getting smuggled out of Gilead. The Mayday operatives who took Daisy into their care convinced her to participate in a dangerous plan to infiltrate Gilead and retrieve a cache of top-secret documents from an anonymous, high-ranking source. Despite initially feeling reluctant about her participation in the mission, Daisy made it into Gilead, and the key role she played getting the documents back out demonstrated her bravery and fortitude. Perhaps more important than her successful infiltration and escape was the new relationship she forged with a Gileadean woman named Agnes, who turned out to be her sister. Not long after losing the only parents she’d ever known, Daisy ends the novel by finding a renewed sense of belonging with her sister and biological mother.
