The titular character is introduced as a kind, gentle man, happy to help his neighbors and well regarded in his Hudson Valley village. Van Winkle seems to be wholly uninterested in taking care of his home and responsibilities. He enjoys nothing more than sitting with other gentlemen of the town, chatting amiably and aimlessly, or spending time alone with his dog, hunting and fishing. It is due to his lack of care that Van Winkle finds himself in the woods where he comes upon the strangers.  

Upon waking, Rip is unsteady on his feet, but only momentarily. Though he’s confused by the changes that have taken place, he is a man comfortable in his own skin, and happiest when nothing is expected of him. When people learn his identity, no one expresses too much concern over his absence, nor his return. As a young man who never wanted to have to do anything, he is in a position to live the life of idleness he always wanted now that he’s older. A classic comedic character, Rip is fairly unchanged by his 18-year absence. He fits back snuggly in his community, now with a tale to tell and no responsibilities.
