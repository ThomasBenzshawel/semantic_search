Willie Mink is a shadowy figure who makes a brief but
				significant appearance at the end of the novel. Long before he actually
				appears in the text, we know of Willie Mink as Mr. Gray, the corrupt
				project manager behind the drug Dylar. Mink has been carrying on
				an affair with Babette, who believes Dylar can alleviate her overwhelming fear
				of dying. Willie Mink is both the center of Jack’s jealous rage and
				Jack’s only hope of getting Dylar himself.

When Willie Mink finally does enter the story, he has
				already become a pathetic, half-crazed figure. Deranged and debilitated,
				he personifies the corrupting influence of technological and media stimuli,
				the novel’s titular white noise. Fixed in front of a soundless television,
				muttering phrases from old shows and commercials, Willie Mink fills
				the narrative with his own white noise, or babblings. For Willie,
				the distinctions between real and artificial have collapsed entirely,
				and he can no longer differentiate between the two. Willie Mink
				is the ultimate casualty of this world of simulations, where characters
				live almost entirely under the illusions they create.
