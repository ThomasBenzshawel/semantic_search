John Hale, the intellectual, naïve witch-hunter, enters
the play in Act I when Parris summons him to examine his daughter,
Betty. In an extended commentary on Hale in Act I, Miller describes
him as “a tight-skinned, eager-eyed intellectual. This is a beloved
errand for him; on being called here to ascertain witchcraft he
has felt the pride of the specialist whose unique knowledge has
at last been publicly called for.” Hale enters in a flurry of activity,
carrying large books and projecting an air of great knowledge. In
the early going, he is the force behind the witch trials, probing
for confessions and encouraging people to testify. Over the course
of the play, however, he experiences a transformation, one more
remarkable than that of any other character. Listening to John Proctor
and Mary Warren, he becomes convinced that they, not Abigail, are
telling the truth. In the climactic scene in the court in Act III,
he throws his lot in with those opposing the witch trials. In tragic
fashion, his about-face comes too late—the trials are no longer
in his hands but rather in those of Danforth and the theocracy,
which has no interest in seeing its proceedings exposed as a sham.

The failure of his attempts to turn the tide renders the
once-confident Hale a broken man. As his belief in witchcraft falters,
so does his faith in the law. In Act IV, it is he who counsels the
accused witches to lie, to confess their supposed sins in order
to save their own lives. In his change of heart and subsequent despair,
Hale gains the audience’s sympathy but not its respect, since he
lacks the moral fiber of Rebecca Nurse or, as it turns out, John
Proctor. Although Hale recognizes the evil of the witch trials,
his response is not defiance but surrender. He insists that survival
is the highest good, even if it means accommodating oneself to injustice—something
that the truly heroic characters can never accept.
