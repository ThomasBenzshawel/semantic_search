On the third day after the surprise attack, Hawkeye, the
					Mohicans, Munro, and Heyward approach the besieged ramparts, which
					still smoke with fire and smell of death. Cora and Alice remain
					missing, and the men desperately seek for signs of life. They find
					no apparent signals or codes. When they begin looking for a trail,
					Uncas discovers part of Cora’s green riding veil. Other clues lead
					the men to the former location of the horses, and they conclude
					that the girls, accompanied by Magua and Gamut, have gone into the
					wilderness. Heyward wants to pursue them immediately, but Hawkeye
					insists upon careful deliberation and planning. Munro, depressed
					by his daughters’ disappearance, is apathetic.

The group spends the night around a fire in the desolate
					ruins of the fort. They eat bear meat for dinner. Looking out at
					the lake, Heyward hears noises. Uncas explain that wolves are prowling
					nearby. Hawkeye is pondering the meaning of paradise when he hears another
					sound. Uncas goes to investigate, and the group hears a rifle shot.
					Chingachgook follows his son, and those left behind hear a splash
					of water and another rifle shot. Chingachgook and Uncas return calmly.
					When Heyward asks what happened, Uncas shows him the scalp of an
					Oneida. After discussing the plan for the next day, the group falls
					asleep.

Hawkeye convinces the others to head north across a lake.
					As they travel across the lake in a light canoe, they are spotted
					and soon tailed by Huron canoes. The group’s superior
					paddling tactics enable them to outpace their enemies, and Hawkeye
					manages to wound one pursuer with Killdeer, his long-range rifle.
					Upon reaching the northern shore, the men move eastward in an attempt
					to deceive the enemy. Carrying the canoe on their shoulders, they
					leave an obvious trail through the woods and end up at a large rock.
					Then they retrace their steps, stepping in their own footprints
					until they reach the brook and paddle to safety on the western shore.
					They hide the canoe and rest for the pursuit that will continue
					the next day.

Uncas finds a trail, and the men follow it, hoping it
					will lead them to the women. The trail peters out and the party
					nearly gives up hope, but Uncas manages to divert the course of
					a small stream, revealing a hidden footprint in the sand bed. According
					to Hawkeye, the footprint indicates that Magua abandoned the horses
					upon reaching Huron territory. The men reluctantly enter
					the enemy territory and travel past a beaver pond, whose dams Heyward
					mistakes for Indian wigwams. An Indian appears in the forest. Ready
					for battle, Hawkeye nearly kills the Indian but soon recognizes
					the stranger as Gamut, painted as an Indian with only a scalping
					tuft of hair on his head.

As Hawkeye laughs at Gamut’s Indian paint and shaved head,
					the psalmodist tells the men that Magua recently separated Alice
					and Cora. Magua has sent Alice to a Huron camp and Cora to a Delaware
					settlement; he has released Gamut only because the Indians thought
					he was insane after they heard his religious singing. Gamut and
					Heyward decide to secretly inform the women that they will soon
					be rescued. Chingachgook disguises Heyward as a clown, since Heyward’s
					knowledge of French can help him to pass as a juggler from Ticonderoga.
					Heyward and Gamut proceed to the camp of the Hurons, while Uncas
					and Hawkeye travel to find Cora in the Delaware camp. At the Huron
					camp, Gamut and Heyward see strange forms rising from the grass.
					When they approach the tents, they realize the strange forms are
					just children at play.

The village usually has no guards, but the whooping of
					the children draws the attention of the warriors. Heyward pretends
					to be a French doctor and attempts to pacify the Hurons, who believe
					the French forces abandoned them. A group of Hurons returns with
					a prisoner and several human scalps. The Huron elders force the
					prisoner to run a race against the tribe’s warriors in order to
					escape. Though the prisoner runs speedily, the Hurons outnumber
					him, and he wins only because Heyward trips one of his pursuers.
					Suddenly, Heyward recognizes the breathless prisoner as Uncas. Meanwhile, in
					the main lodge, the father of the man who captured Uncas condemns
					his son for cowardice and stabs him in the heart.

In these chapters, Cooper ponders the moral significance
					of the massacre. Cora and Alice do not appear in these chapters,
					and Cooper temporarily turns away from the sentimental concerns
					of love and marriage to write about the acts of physical violence
					that men perpetrate against one another. Cooper condemns the interracial
					violence that occurs at the fort, using the distress of the characters
					to show his own distress. He absents the religious man Gamut from
					the scenes, which suggests that Cooper does not oppose unprovoked violence
					on religious grounds but on absolute moral grounds. No matter the
					time, place, or creed, the slaughter of a woman and child is wrong.

	Cooper condemns those who practice violence rashly and
					praises those who remain calm and murder only because necessity
					demands it. When Heyward, Munro, and Uncas desire immediate retribution,
					they threaten to repeat the very brutal hastiness for which they condemn
					the Hurons. The measured deliberation of Chingachgook and Hawkeye
					counterbalances the dangers of rash action. Heyward acts like an
					eager, bloodthirsty schoolboy when he excitedly theorizes about
					the noises he hears and asks to know what happened. Cooper contrasts
					his yipping with the calm and sobriety of Chingachgook and Uncas,
					who display the scalps of their murder victims without pride or
					excitement. They had to kill in order to save their lives and their
					friends’ lives, but they did so carefully, without allowing bloodlust
					or excitement to overwhelm them.

Cooper takes great liberties with historical events to
					make his villains seem more villainous and his heroes more heroic.
					Cooper fabricates the idiocy of the Hurons in order to make them
					unappealing. In Chapter XXII, Heyward poses as a clown and successfully
					impersonates a French doctor. Because the Hurons fall for this ruse,
					they appear foolish. Cooper satirizes the Indians for failing to
					distinguish between the science and recreation of white culture.
					But Cooper’s ridicule is not malicious; it stems from his attempt
					to make his narrative more riveting, to give his readers a group
					against whom they can root.

	The disguises that fill these chapters suggest the novel’s
					debt to traditional romances. The British Romantic age began officially with
					the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads by
					William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but the techniques
					of romance—including comedy, burlesque, exaggeration, and disguise—date
					back to the medieval period and the fabliaux of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury
						Tales. Romantic writing of the nineteenth century emphasizes
					imagination over reason. Although Cooper grounds his novel in historical
					events, imagination dictates the course of the plot.
