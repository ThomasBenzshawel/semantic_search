True to the “fleet” in her last name, Lina never stops running, and not just because her job requires her to ferry messages all over the city. She rushes to share good news, to announce a new idea, and to evade trouble, all while taking note of exactly where she is in the city and seeking out new discoveries. Lina is seldom impatient, but most of the time she truly cannot wait to see what comes next.

In her quieter moments Lina is pensive, and this is when her imagination runs free. She processes information visually, envisioning herself in different scenarios translating her ideas about a new city into drawings. She also pauses frequently to take stock of her situation and consider what and whom she values, and to compare her past and present relationships with people. Her capacity for self-evaluation and boundless energy makes her a perfect foil for Doon.
