Into Thin Air is a nonfiction book by outdoors writer Jon Krakauer that was first published in 1997. It describes in great detail the tragedy that Krakauer witnessed and participated in when eight climbers attempting to summit Mount Everest died when a storm hit. In forensic detail, Krakauer breaks down the events and assigns blame to those he believes is responsible for the deathsâ€”a list that Krakauer includes himself on. In the postscript for the paperback edition of Into Thin Air, Krakauer addresses criticisms of his account of the disaster.
