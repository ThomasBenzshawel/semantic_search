Dunya is Raskolnikov’s sister and shares many of his traits.
				She is intelligent, proud, beautiful, and strong-willed. But in
				most other ways, she is Raskolnikov’s exact opposite. Whereas he
				is self-centered, cruel, and prone to intellectualizing, she is
				self-sacrificing, kind, and exhibits endless compassion. The relationship
				between Dunya and Raskolnikov is always based on mutual love and respect,
				but it swings from one extreme of emotion to the other as Raskolnikov
				slowly approaches the moment of confession. In many ways, Dunya
				is more mature than her brother: while he grows angry and dizzy
				confronting Luzhin, she remains confident and in control, even when
				she becomes just as angry. She is the strongest female character
				in the novel, neither as crushed by poverty nor as timid as Sonya.
				If there are any heroes in Crime and Punishment,
				she, along with Razumikhin, is certainly one of them, which makes
				their marriage at the end of the novel particularly appropriate.
