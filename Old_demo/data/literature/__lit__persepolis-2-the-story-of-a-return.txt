The English-language edition of Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return by Marjane Satrapi was published by Pantheon in 2004 and named Book of the Year by Entertainment Weekly and the San Francisco Chronicle. The graphic memoir is the follow-up to Satrapi’s critically-acclaimed Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood. The original French version of the story was released in four parts from 2000 to 2003, and Persepolis 2 covers parts three and four. Satrapi’s language and simple black-and-white drawings make her cross-cultural coming-of-age tale accessible, relatable, and profoundly engaging.
