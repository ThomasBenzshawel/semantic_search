Bram Stoker’s Dracula, published in 1897, is a quintessential Gothic novel that has left an indelible mark on the vampire genre. It is also an epistolary novel with a narrative conveyed through letters, diary entries, and newspaper articles, as Jonathan Harker discovers the sinister truth about Count Dracula’s vampiric intentions. Set against the backdrop of Victorian England and Gothic Transylvania, the novel delves into themes of superstition, sexuality, and the clash between ancient evil and modernity.

Historically, Dracula reflects the anxieties of late 19th-century Victorian society, addressing issues of sexuality, immigration, and the fear of the unknown. The novel’s investigation of the undead and the supernatural serves as a metaphor for societal fears. In contemporary contexts, Dracula remains a cornerstone of vampire lore and has inspired countless adaptations, reflecting its ongoing influence on popular culture.

Significant adaptations of Dracula have permeated various forms of media. Bela Lugosi’s portrayal in the iconic 1931 film Dracula directed by Tod Browning set the standard for the cinematic representation of the character. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1992 film Bram Stoker’s Dracula brought a visually stunning and more faithful adaptation to the screen. Beyond film, Dracula has inspired numerous TV series, plays, and reinterpretations, cementing its status as a timeless and influential work in the horror genre.
