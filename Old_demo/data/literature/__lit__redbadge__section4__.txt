Stomping through the forest, Henry hears “the crimson
					roar” of battle. Hoping to get a closer look, he heads toward it.
					He comes upon a column of wounded men stumbling along a road, and notices
					one spectral soldier with a vacant gaze. Henry joins the column
					and a soldier with a bloody head and a dangling arm begins to talk
					to him. Henry tries to avoid this tattered man, but the wounded soldier
					continues to talk about the courage and fortitude of the army, exuding
					pride that his regiment did not flee from the fighting. He asks
					Henry where he has been wounded, and Henry hurries away in a panic.

Henry falls back in the procession to avoid the tattered
					man. As he observes the wounded soldiers around him, he becomes
					envious of their injuries; he considers a wound proof of valor—a
					“red badge of courage”—and wishes that he had one. He walks by the
					spectral soldier that he noticed earlier, a gray man staring blankly
					into “the unknown.” Henry suddenly realizes the man’s identity and
					cries out: “Gawd! Jim Conklin!” Jim greets Henry wearily and asks where
					he has been, telling him, “I got shot.”

Jim adds that he is afraid of falling down and being run
					over by the artillery wagons. Henry promises to take care of him.
					Jim seems reassured, but soon orders Henry to leave him alone and
					not touch him. Baffled, Henry tries to lead Jim into the fields,
					where the artillery wagons will not frighten him, but Jim musters
					the strength to run away toward a small clump of bushes. Henry and
					the tattered man follow after him, watching in horror as Jim convulses,
					collapses, and dies. The flap of Jim’s blue jacket falls away from
					his body, and Henry sees that his side looks “as if it had been
					chewed by wolves.” Consumed with rage at his friend’s death, Henry
					clenches his fist and shakes it angrily in the direction of the
					battlefield.

The tattered man marvels at the strength that Jim mustered
					before death, wondering how he managed to run when his injury should have
					rendered him unable to walk. Henry and the tattered man move away
					from the corpse. The tattered man says that he is feeling “pretty
					damn’ bad,” and Henry worries that he is about to witness another
					death. The tattered man says, however, that he is not about to die—he
					has children who need him to survive. He mistakes Henry for his
					friend Tom Jamison and tells him that he also looks weak, and that
					he should have his wound looked at. He adds that he once saw a man
					shot in the head so that the man did not realize he was hurt until
					he was already dead.

Tormented, Henry leaves the tattered man behind.
					As he stalks away, the tattered man, whom Henry knows will almost
					certainly die if abandoned, seems to lose his focus, and begins
					crying out to Henry. Driven to distraction by the tattered man’s
					questions about his wound, Henry cannot bear the thought of anyone discovering
					“his crime.”

The encounters with Jim and the tattered man force Henry
					to reconcile fantasy with reality. He views the wounded soldiers
					as heroic and enviable, but watches two of them die. Henry is deeply
					ashamed of his own cowardice in running from battle, and longs for
					a wound to validate his nerve. But the soldiers who acted as he
					wishes he could have—one of them his childhood friend Jim Conklin—both die
					of their wounds. The apparent necessity of navigating this conflict
					between life and honor troubles Henry greatly.

Nowhere in the novel is the tension between the human
					instinct of self-preservation and the impetus toward moral behavior
					stronger or more upsetting to Henry. Though he anxiously wishes
					to act bravely to earn the praise and envy of others, he is afraid
					to die. The pathetic fates of the tattered man and Jim arouse these
					conflicting emotions in Henry, causing him to experience unbearable
					self-doubt. He modifies the positive connection between battle wound and
					courage into an inverse correlation between battle wound and shame:
					since he has not been injured, he feels his disgrace is visible
					to everyone around him. Too immature to confront his insecurities, Henry
					evades them by rashly abandoning the dying, tattered man, whose
					battle wound underscores the courage that Henry lacks.

Henry’s various experiences with nature’s indifference
					to human concerns further complicate his outlook by removing his
					sense of moral absolutes: if the universe has no regard for human
					concerns, then human moral conventions do not reflect a definitive,
					natural spectrum of right and wrong. Henry comes to believe that
					human beings are not inherently moral animals; rather, they have
					simply constructed an arbitrary and inflexible system of morality
					that often runs counter to their own instincts. In contrast, nature’s
					definitive, nonarbitrary judgments of right and wrong change with,
					and are dependent on, the human value of self-preservation.

In this environment, the idea of a wound appeals immensely
					to the troubled, young Henry. While it may seem ironic that an individual
					who fears danger would long for an injury, Henry considers a wound
					irrefutable proof of the moral position he so desperately seeks,
					a symbol not only of courage but also of an entire value system
					that nature ignores.
