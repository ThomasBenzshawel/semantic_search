Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman is a memoir developed by American anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that was first published in 1981. It tells the story of the life of Nisa, which is the pseudonym Shostak gave a member of the !Kung tribe of hunter-gatherers from southern Africa's Kalahari desert who she interviewed extensively in the 1970s. Told from Nisaâ€™s vibrant and riveting perspective, Nisa manages to overcome the formidable barriers of language and culture to provide a compelling view of an incredible woman and her society.
