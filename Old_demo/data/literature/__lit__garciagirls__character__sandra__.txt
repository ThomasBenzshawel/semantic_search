Sandra's artistic abilities were frustrated as a child
				by poor art instruction and a terrible fall which badly broke her
				arm. She felt stifled as a child by her parents' desires to fit
				into American culture and was criticized for expressing her own
				needs or hopes. She grew disillusioned with American virtue after
				watching a drunk woman kiss her father. Her inability to express
				herself artistically or personally led to an eventual mental breakdown,
				characterized by her belief that she was moving backward through
				evolution and was losing her humanity. This loss of humanity symbolizes
				her loss of artistic inspiration and a sense of her own unique identity.
