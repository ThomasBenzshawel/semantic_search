The narrator says that Volumnia finds Sir Leicester sprawled
					on the floor of the library. She screams, causing a commotion and
					bringing servants running to help. Sir Leicester is much weaker
					and quieter than he was before. He can barely speak and writes notes
					to communicate. When he asks about Lady Dedlock, the doctors say
					she has gone out and doesn’t yet know Sir Leicester is sick. They
					let Mrs. Rouncewell give Sir Leicester the letter from Lady Dedlock.
					Sir Leicester requests Bucket. He tells Bucket that he fully forgives
					Lady Dedlock and asks him to find her immediately. Before Bucket
					leaves, he reassures Mrs. Rouncewell that George will be fine and
					that her immediate concern must be attending to Sir Leicester.

Bucket first inspects Lady Dedlock’s chambers. In a drawer,
					he finds a white handkerchief with Esther’s name on it. He rushes
					to George, who tells him Esther’s address. When he reaches Esther’s home,
					he shows the letter to Mr. Jarndyce and says he fears Lady Dedlock
					is going to kill herself. Bucket says he needs Esther to go with
					him on his search, and Mr. Jarndyce gets her. The narrator ruminates
					on where Lady Dedlock is and then says there is a figure wearing
					shabby clothes fleeing near the brick kilns.

Esther tells us that when Mr. Jarndyce wakes her up, she
					immediately prepares to go with Bucket. Bucket reads her the letter,
					and they set off. Bucket asks her a few questions about her relationship with
					Lady Dedlock and if there is anyone Lady Dedlock may have confided
					in. Esther says perhaps Mr. Boythorn. Bucket stops in a police station
					and quietly gives instructions to a few men. They continue on their
					journey. Bucket stops by the water and speaks to some policemen
					and sailors, then he inspects what Esther suspects is a person who
					drowned. They make several other stops as they go on and eventually
					head toward Saint Albans. After another stop, where Bucket gets
					Esther a cup of tea, he says he’s been told that Lady Dedlock passed
					through there that evening. They head toward Bleak House. Bucket
					tells Esther that he took Jo away when she’d been sheltering him
					in the stable to protect Lady Dedlock since Jo had been telling
					too many people about the lady he led to the burial ground.

At Bleak House, Bucket asks if Skimpole always stays in
					the same room when he visits. He tells Esther that Skimpole had
					showed him where to find Jo after Bucket had given him some money
					for the information. Esther feels betrayed by Skimpole, and Bucket
					warns her to watch out for people like Skimpole. None of the servants
					at Bleak House has seen Lady Dedlock.

Bucket and Esther head toward the brickmaker’s cottage.
					There, Esther finds out that Jenny, Liz, and their husbands live
					together in a single cottage. Jenny is not there, but they speak
					to the others. Bucket asserts that he knows a lady had been there
					the night before; Jenny’s husband is defensive and unresponsive.
					Esther suspects that Liz wants to talk to her alone, but there is
					no way for her to do this. Esther asks where Jenny is, but before
					Liz can answer, her husband kicks her. Jenny’s husband says she
					went to London last night. Esther asks if Jenny was home when the
					lady visited. Liz asks her husband if she can answer, but her husband
					threatens her. Jenny’s husband says Jenny was home, and that the
					lady asked for Esther’s handkerchief. Then he says that the lady
					went one way and Jenny went the other. He says he isn’t sure what
					time it was, since they don’t have a watch. Esther asks how the
					lady looked, and Liz said she didn’t look well. They leave the cottage.

Outside, Bucket tells Esther he’s sure Lady Dedlock gave
					them her watch, since it was strange for Jenny’s husband to mention
					a watch. He wonders what they gave Lady Dedlock in return and says that
					if Liz had been alone she probably would have told them more. Bucket
					speculates that Lady Dedlock may have sent Jenny to London to see
					Esther, but they continue on straight ahead.

It’s snowing, and the snow slows their journey. Bucket
					seems to lose some of his confidence and eventually admits that
					he has lost the trail. At an inn, Esther faints and is then cared
					for by the landlady and her daughters. Later, when they stop again
					to change horses, Bucket realizes something and says he finally
					understands. He excitedly orders the driver to return to London,
					which shocks Esther. He says he is going to follow Jenny. Esther
					protests that they shouldn’t abandon Lady Dedlock, but Bucket tells
					her not to worry.

The narrator says that at the Dedlock town house, people
					are told that Lady Dedlock has gone to Lincolnshire, but rumors
					abound about where she really is and what has happened between her
					and Sir Leicester. Sir Leicester is still bedridden. In the morning,
					he instructs Mrs. Rouncewell to have Lady Dedlock’s rooms prepared for
					her. Mrs. Rouncewell admits to George that she thinks Lady Dedlock
					will not be returning to Chesney Wold or anywhere else. She says
					that Lady Dedlock told her yesterday that the footsteps on the Ghost’s
					Walk had “almost walked her down.”

The narrator describes the abandoned appearance of Lady
					Dedlock’s rooms. Mrs. Rouncewell and George help the servants light fires
					and prepare for her return. Volumnia sits with Sir Leicester. When
					Mrs. Rouncewell returns, Volumnia praises George, and Mrs. Rouncewell
					explains to Sir Leicester that George is her long-lost son. Sir
					Leicester seems hopeful at the news and asks to see George immediately.

George appears and helps arrange Sir Leicester more comfortably
					in his bed. Sir Leicester tells George he is unwell, that he has
					had an attack that “deadens” and “confuses” (most likely a stroke).
					He tells everyone in the room—Volumnia, Mrs. Rouncewell, and George—that
					if he gets worse and becomes unable to communicate, then they should
					make it known that his feelings for Lady Dedlock have not changed
					whatsoever and that he harbors no anger toward her. After his speech
					he lays back. George stays with him.

The narrator says that the day is coming to an end, but
					that Sir Leicester is unwilling to admit it. Mrs. Rouncewell convinces
					him to rest. He maintains his hopes by thinking that her rooms are
					prepared for her arrival. Eventually, everyone goes to bed, except
					for Mrs. Rouncewell and George. Volumnia can’t sleep, worrying that if
					Sir Leicester dies she will have no income. George runs into her
					as he walks around the house and convinces her to go to bed.

The morning comes.

Esther tells us that she and Bucket reach London around
					three in the morning. Esther still fears they’ve abandoned Lady
					Dedlock, but Bucket assures her he has reasons for coming back.
					As they travel through the winding London streets, Bucket occasionally
					stops and meets with others. Finally he says he’s tracked the woman
					down and that they need to walk for a bit. As they walk down Chancery
					Lane, they cross paths with Mr. Woodcourt, and he joins them. Woodcourt
					says he has been with Richard, who is not well.

They arrive at Mr. Snagsby’s and hear a girl sobbing.
					Bucket says it’s the Snagsbys’ servant, Guster, and that he needs
					information from her. He asks Woodcourt to try to calm her down
					so that Bucket can get a letter he needs. Mr. Snagsby lets them
					in and introduces them to Mrs. Snagsby. Woodcourt and Snagsby go
					to see Guster. Bucket chastises Mrs. Snagsby for being so jealous
					and suspicious. Woodcourt returns with the letter, and Bucket asks
					Esther whose writing it is. She says it’s Lady Dedlock’s. The letter
					says she went to the cottage and got help from Jenny, and that her
					only purpose is to die.

Esther asks Guster how she got the letter. Guster says
					she had been running errands when a woman stopped her, asking the
					way to the burial ground. Guster says it was the burial ground in
					which Krook’s lodger was buried. The lady gave Guster a letter and instructed
					her to send it.

They leave the Snagsbys’ house and rush to the burial
					ground. Esther is numb and confused. At the gate to the burial ground,
					she sees a woman on the ground, who she thinks is Jenny. She starts
					to run toward her, but Bucket stops her, telling her that he suspects Lady
					Dedlock and Jenny traded clothes and that Jenny walked only a short
					distance before turning around and going home. The purpose was to
					deceive. Esther doesn’t understand what all this means. She goes
					to the woman and sees that it is Lady Dedlock, dead.

Esther says that she doesn’t want to discuss her sadness
					too much and that she will move on in her story. She says that she
					becomes briefly sick in London and that Mrs. Woodcourt stays with
					them for a while. Mr. Jarndyce suggests they stay in London so that
					Esther can be closer to Ada. Esther asks if he sees Woodcourt, and
					Mr. Jarndyce says he sees him every day. Mr. Jarndyce wants to stay
					in London so that he can get news of Richard more easily, since
					Richard won’t speak to him. Mr. Jarndyce asks Esther if she likes
					Mrs. Woodcourt, and Esther answers that she does. Mr. Jarndyce asks
					if she has any objections to Mrs. Woodcourt’s staying with them,
					and even though Esther says she doesn’t, she is unsettled without
					really knowing why. Mr. Jarndyce tells Esther that Mr. Woodcourt
					will probably not be leaving the country and may instead take up
					a position in Yorkshire.

Esther visits Ada every day. She sometimes sees Richard,
					and he is much changed. Esther understands that Vholes is taking
					all of Richard’s money. She suspects Ada doesn’t understand that
					Richard is destroying himself. During one visit, Miss Flite is just
					leaving when Esther arrives. Miss Flite says she doesn’t like Vholes
					and that she has made Richard the executor of her estate, since
					he is at Chancery so much. She had planned to appoint Gridley, but
					he had died. Vholes joins Esther, Ada, and Richard for dinner. When
					Richard and Ada are out of the room, Vholes tells Esther he thinks
					Richard and Ada’s marriage was unwise and that Richard and his interests are
					doing very poorly. When Vholes leaves after dinner, Richard overpraises
					him, which makes Esther think that he has actually begun to doubt
					Vholes.

Mr. Woodcourt arrives, and he and Richard go for a walk.
					Ada tells Esther that when she married Richard, she knew what she
					was getting into but hoped she could change him. She says that she
					has been determined not to make him any unhappier than he already was.
					She also reveals that she’s pregnant. She has hoped that the baby
					will save Richard, but now she is afraid that Richard will die before
					the baby is born.

Lady Dedlock is Sir Leicester’s greatest weakness, and
					the revelation of her secret personal history is enough to nearly
					destroy him. Bombastic, influential Sir Leicester collapses when
					he learns Lady Dedlock’s secret, losing his ability to move and
					speak after suffering what appears to be a stroke. Suddenly bedridden,
					he is dependent on his subordinates to care for him and understand
					him. Although there are many tragedies in Bleak House, Jo’s
					death among them, the fall of Sir Leicester may be the most affecting.
					We may see it as a tragedy caused by love: Lady Dedlock hid her
					secret to protect Sir Leicester and then fled to escape the wrath
					she expected, while Sir Leicester forgives her easily and fully
					despite her transgressions. He never has the chance to prove the
					depth of his devotion, nor does Lady Dedlock ever have the opportunity
					to see it. Their partnership has never been an obviously warm one,
					thanks in part to Lady Dedlock’s carefully maintained haughtiness,
					but the tragic fall of Sir Leicester shows that there was passion
					in their marriage after all.

Esther and Bucket’s frantic nighttime pursuit of Lady
					Dedlock ratchets up the suspense of the novel, and Dickens skillfully
					raises the tension by switching between his two narrators more frequently than
					usual. The third-person narrator narrates chapter 56,
					describing Sir Leicester’s sad state and then following Bucket as
					he calls for Esther in the middle of the night. Esther takes over
					the narration in chapter 57, and she leads
					us on their fast, feverish journey. The chapter ends in a rush,
					with Bucket making the unexpected decision to return to London.
					The third-person narrator takes over again in chapter 58,
					removing us from the nighttime journey and taking us back to Sir
					Leicester, who is waiting earnestly in his bed for news. In chapter 59,
					we’re back out in the cold with Esther as the search continues and
					finally ends. This quick back-and-forth, which jerks us in and out
					of the action of the search, increases the suspense of the journey
					and raises the stakes. Esther is not the only one frantic to find
					Lady Dedlock; Sir Leicester, who has prepared Lady Dedlock’s rooms
					and lit the fires, is perhaps even more desperate than she is. Dickens’s
					use of two narrators in these chapters is perhaps more affecting
					than at any other point in the novel.

Esther demonstrates a remarkable control over her narrative
					in chapters 59 and 60,
					proving once again that she is an agile storyteller and a confident
					guide through this sordid, bulky tale. Although she is narrating Bleak
						House from a point seven years in the future, she withholds
					information and feigns ignorance when doing so increases the dramatic
					effect. We’ve seen her do this with her feelings for Woodcourt,
					which increased the poignancy of Mr. Jarndyce’s proposal. In this
					section, when Esther, Bucket, and Woodcourt finally find the woman
					they’ve been pursuing, who Esther believes is Jenny, she tells us
					she doesn’t understand what Bucket is getting at when he explains
					that Jenny and Lady Dedlock switched clothes. When Esther sees that
					the woman is actually Lady Dedlock’s body, we share her shock. She
					has successfully drawn us into her own disoriented confusion to
					make the story more intriguing.
