Before his imprisonment, Edmond Dantès is a kind, innocent,
				honest, and loving man. Though naturally intelligent, he is a man
				of few opinions, living his life instinctively by a traditional
				code of ethics that impels him to honor his superiors, care dutifully
				for his aging father, and treat his fellow man generously. Dantès
				is filled with positive feeling, admiring his boss, Monsieur Morrel;
				loving his father; adoring his fiancée, Mercédès; and even attempting
				to think kindly of men who clearly dislike him.

While in prison, however, Dantès undergoes a great change.
				He becomes bitter and vengeful as he obsesses over the wrongs committed
				against him. When his companion, Abbé Faria, dies, so too does Dantès’s
				only remaining deep connection to another human being. Dantès loses
				the capacity to feel any emotion other than hatred for those who
				have harmed him and gratitude toward those who have tried to help
				him. He moves through the world like an outsider, disconnected from
				any human community and interested only in carrying out his mission
				as the agent of Providence. It is not until Dantès finds love again,
				in a relationship with Haydée, that he is able to reconnect to his
				own humanity and begin to live humanly again.
