Albert is an excellent businessman and a sensible, loving fiancé and husband. His patience for Werther’s antics and outbursts even though he must suspect Werther’s feelings for Charlotte suggest a confidence and maturity that neither of the star-crossed lovers possess. Like Wilhelm, he is a foil for Werther, and his interactions with Charlotte serve to illustrate what a healthy romantic relationship might look like. He ultimately advises Charlotte to spend less time with Werther not because of his obvious infatuation with her but because of his increasingly erratic behavior.
