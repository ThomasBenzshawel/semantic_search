Ebi is Marji’s father and a hardworking, kind, and proud man. His primary motivation is love for his family and friends and a desire for safety, stability, and dignity. Ebi holds deep convictions about justice and freedom, but these convictions are secondary motivations for him. In the early days of the Revolution, Ebi and his wife Taji are compelled to participate in the protests against the Shah. They both feel the protests are important in sending a strong message to the Shah’s regime. Ebi is therefore jubilant when the Shah is deposed, and he believes in the ability of the educated minority in Iran to steer the country towards democracy. When these hopes are dashed, it is clear to Ebi that Iran is becoming a dangerous place for him and his family. However, his dignity and pride lead him to choose to stay in Iran. By doing so, he can hold onto his privileged social station and provide for his family. Ebi’s gamble is that by keeping his head mostly down, his wealth and status can protect Marji and Taji. Ebi’s decision, along with his wife’s, to send Marji away stems from his desire to protect her at all costs. It is bitterly Ironic that this decision means separation and possible estrangement from the daughter he cherishes.
