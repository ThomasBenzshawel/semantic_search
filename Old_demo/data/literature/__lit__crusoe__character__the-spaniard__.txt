The Spaniard is another character whom Robison saves from the cannibals, much like Friday and Friday’s father. When Crusoe asks in Portuguese for he man to identify himself, the Spaniard weakly responds in Latin: “Christianus.” It’s unclear whether this is his given name or simply an indication of his religion; for the duration of their time together, Crusoe refers to the man simply as “the Spaniard.”

Similar to Friday, and also Xury, the Spaniard’s character lacks much description or complexity. Rather, the Spaniard’s character serves to intensify Crusoe’s traits, particularly those of ownership and self-importance. The Spaniard, to a lesser extent than Friday, becomes subordinate to Crusoe on the island, helping him further develop and maintain his “kingdom.”
