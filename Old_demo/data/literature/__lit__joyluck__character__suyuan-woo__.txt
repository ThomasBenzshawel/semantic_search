Suyuan Woo is a strong and willful woman who refuses to
				focus on her hardships. Instead, she struggles to create happiness
				and success where she finds it lacking. It is with this mentality
				that she founds the original Joy Luck Club while awaiting the Japanese
				invasion of China in Kweilin. Her sense of the power of will can
				at times cause problems, such as when Suyuan believes that her daughter
				Jing-mei can be a child prodigy if only the Woos can locate her
				talent and nurture it well enough. This leads to a deep resentment
				in Jing-mei. Yet it is also by virtue of Suyuan’s will that she
				eventually locates her long-lost twin daughters in China. Only her
				death prevents her from returning to them.

Suyuan shares many characteristics with her fellow mothers
				in the Joy Luck Club: fierce love for her daughter, often expressed
				as criticism; a distress at her daughter’s desire to shake off her
				Chinese identity in favor of an American one; and a fear that she
				may be alienated from her daughter either because of her own actions
				or because of their divergent ages and cultural upbringings.
