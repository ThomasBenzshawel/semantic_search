No single character dominates the Metamorphosesâ€™ 
250 stories from
				Greek and Roman mythology, legend, and history. Only the narrator,
				a version of Ovid, unites and controls the narrative. He makes his
				presence known with attention-getting literary techniques. Often,
				there is no logical or structural reason why one story precedes
				or follows another. Rather, the narrator arranges them according
				to more subtle principles. The unobvious, often surprising structure
				draws attention to itself, and to its author. We are never allowed
				to forget that a literary mind has constructed the poem. The narrator
				also draws the focus to himself by breaking into the narrative and,
				in the first person, offering his perspective and insights.
