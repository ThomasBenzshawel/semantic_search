Originally published by Washington Irving as part of the short story collection The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent in 1819, "Rip Van Winkle" was immediately embraced by the reading public and has maintained popularity ever since. The story is considered to be a masterpiece of the form, combining elements of both the traditional folktale and the travel narrative. Along with "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," "Rip Van Winkle" established Irving as an important and abiding figure in American literature.
