The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a novel written by Mark Twain, first published in 1876. The story is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, and follows the adventures of a young boy named Tom Sawyer who is known for his mischievous and adventurous nature. The novel explores his various escapades, including treasure hunts, whitewashing a fence, and witnessing a murder. The narrative also features Tom’s romantic interest in Becky Thatcher and his friendship with Huckleberry Finn, a character who would be the subject of Twain’s 1885 adventure novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

Set in the pre-Civil War era, the novel captures the spirit of small-town America along the Mississippi River. Mark Twain drew inspiration from his own experiences growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, and the novel reflects the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the time. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is considered a classic of American literature in its own right and as a precursor to the more complex and mature The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

The enduring popularity of the novel lies in its timeless portrayal of childhood and the universal themes of friendship, imagination, and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Tom Sawyer’s character, with his wit and charm, has become an iconic figure in American literature, and the novel continues to be widely read and studied in schools.
