Go Down, Moses is a novel by Nobel Prize winner William Faulkner, first published in 1942. The book is comprised of seven interconnected stories that span several generations of the McCaslin family, a prominent Mississippi clan. The stories are not presented in chronological order, but rather in an order that allows for the gradual revelation of the family’s history and the ways in which its members are connected to one another. The central theme of Go Down, Moses is the destructive legacy of slavery and the ways in which it continues to shape the lives of both Black and white Americans.
