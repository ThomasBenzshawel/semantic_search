Saleem’s younger sister, initially known as the Brass
				Monkey, is born into the world with little fanfare. She eventually
				grows up to become the most famous singer in Pakistan, adored throughout
				the country. As a child, Saleem notes that the Brass Monkey learned
				at an early age that if she wanted attention, she would have to
				make a lot of noise, which is precisely what she does. She becomes
				a mischievous child who garners attention by destroying things and remains
				unable to accept love throughout her adult life. The playful and
				impish nature of her youth is lost almost immediately upon her arrival
				in Pakistan. There, in a religiously devout country, she succumbs
				to the laws of devotion and patriotism, just as her brother becomes
				more invested in the profane elements of life. She goes through
				extraordinary lengths to keep herself veiled, and her voice is described
				as being “pure,” reflecting the ideals of a country that values
				wholesomeness in its women. Despite her devotion, Jamila Singer
				retains elements of her former self. She rebels against her dietary
				constraints by secretly eating leavened bread, baked by Catholic
				nuns, and she openly criticizes the Pakistani army when they abuse
				her brother.
