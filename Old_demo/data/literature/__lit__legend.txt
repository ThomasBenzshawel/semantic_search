Legend is the first in a four-book series of dystopian young adult novels by Chinese-American author Marie Lu. The book explores the intersecting stories of two teens—June, a military prodigy, and Day, the country's most wanted criminal—in a police state located in what was once the western United States. Lu has said that the conflict between June and Day is meant to be reminiscent of that between Javert and Jean Valjean in Les Misérables. Published in 2011, Legend was followed by Prodigy and Champion in 2013, and then by Rebel in 2019. Legend was adapted into a graphic novel in 2015.
