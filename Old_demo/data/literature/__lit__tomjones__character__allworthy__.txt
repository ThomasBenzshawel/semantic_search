Allworthy, as his name implies, is also an allegorical figure of sorts. His
				character does not undergo any dramatic changes and thus possesses the
				consistency and stability found in stock characters in theatrical comedy.
				Allworthy, as Fielding's moral yardstick and as the novel's ultimate dispenser
				of justice and mercy, almost takes on the role of a god, although he is still
				mortal enough to make incorrect judgments. Allworthy's blindness to the evil
				designs of his nephew Blifil and to Thwackum's insidiousness lead him to
				make mistakes which propel the plot of the novel forward. For example, it is
				Allworthy who banishes Tom Jones from his county.
