Eamon Bailey is the public-facing entity of the three Wise Men, the three leaders of the Circle. Bailey is a family man and has an unostentatious home he shares with his wife and kids. Bailey’s son has cerebral palsy, which makes Bailey especially attuned to public acts of charity. He has a secret library where he collects books and antiques and has a fire station-like pole that leads to his parking spot below the Circle’s campus, indicating his obsession with traditional values and the past. Bailey’s progressive ideas that technology can change and better the world border on the evangelical. He becomes a satirical figure in some cases, especially when he equates deleting information with killing a baby and hides his eyes from a shark eating another fish. Bailey is responsible for influencing Mae to become transparent and making her life completely public after subtly influencing her with guilt and shame after she’s caught stealing a kayak. Bailey’s apparent short-sightedness over his utopian, progressive visions makes him a complicated figure, as he’s responsible for leading the Circle towards Completion, and completely obliterating online privacy rights.
