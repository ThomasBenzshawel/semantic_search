In many ways, Ali is a parallel character to Hassan. Both share the same social status as poor, ethnic Hazaras, both are devoted childhood friends to Baba and Amir respectively, and both have physical deformities. Most significantly, both characters deal with betrayal at the hands of their masters. Baba has sex with Ali’s wife, setting into motion all of the interpersonal betrayals that occur throughout the novel. Despite this infidelity, Ali remains a dedicated servant to Baba. Ali represents a particularly faithful, traditional Muslim perspective. None of the other characters in the novel overtly display this same level of faith, and Hosseini presents it as part of Ali’s admirable moral fortitude. Ali is also the first person to learn what happened between Hassan and Amir in the alley. Because of this knowledge, Ali allows Hassan to lie about stealing Amir’s watch and birthday money, causing Ali and Hassan’s departure from Baba’s household. In this heartbreaking and ultimately self-sacrificing act, Ali, despite his limited social power, does what he can to protect his son from Amir’s betrayal.
