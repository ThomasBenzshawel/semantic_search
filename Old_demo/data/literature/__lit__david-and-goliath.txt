David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, a work of nonfiction published in 2013, is the fifth book by Canadian journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell. Through a collection of essays, case studies, and research examples, Gladwell challenges how readers perceive obstacles and disadvantages. In David and Goliath, Gladwell describes how sometimes disadvantages can turn into advantages, arguing that true underdogs succeed because they recognize their shortcomings and think outside of the box to overcome seemingly impossible odds.
