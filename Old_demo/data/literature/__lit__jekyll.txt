The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, first published in 1886, is a classic tale of duality and the consequences of unchecked scientific experimentation. It is now more commonly known as just Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Set in Victorian London, the novella tells the story of Dr. Henry Jekyll, a well-respected scientist, and his mysterious and malevolent alter ego, Mr. Edward Hyde. Jekyll’s experiments with a potion lead to the physical and moral transformation into Hyde, an embodiment of his darker impulses.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde explores the theme of the duality of human nature, the struggle between good and evil, and the consequences of tampering with the natural order. The foggy and ominous streets of Victorian London provide a fitting backdrop to the unfolding mystery, contributing to the suspenseful atmosphere of the narrative. Stevenson's exploration of the consequences of scientific curiosity and the ethical implications of separating the good and evil aspects of one's personality is both thought-provoking and chilling.

The novella’s capturing of the enduring fascination with the dark side of human nature has ensured its popularity in stage plays, films, and television productions over the years. Fredric March won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jekyll and Hyde in the 1931 film version.
