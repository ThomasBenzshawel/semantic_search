Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, first published as a serial in 1837-1839, is a classic novel that vividly portrays the harsh realities of 19th-century London. The story follows the orphaned Oliver Twist, who endures a life of hardship in a workhouse before embarking on a series of adventures that bring him into contact with a colorful cast of characters, including the criminal Fagin and the kindly Mr. Brownlow.

Set against the backdrop of social and economic inequality, Dickens uses Oliver Twist to critique the harsh treatment of the poor and vulnerable in Victorian society. The novel explores themes of poverty, crime, and the corrupting influence of societal structures. Oliver’s journey from the workhouse to the criminal underworld and, ultimately, to a more compassionate and stable life reflects Dickens’s commitment to social reform and his belief in the potential for redemption.

Published at the dawn of the Victorian era, a period marked by rapid industrialization and social upheaval, Oliver Twist resonated with readers for its vivid characters, gripping plot, and social commentary. The novel has since become a classic of English literature and has been adapted into numerous films, stage plays, and other media, including a 1948 film directed by David Lean and a 1968 Academy Award Best Picture winning musical version called Oliver! that was directed by Carol Reed.
