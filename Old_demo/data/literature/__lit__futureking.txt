The Once and Future King is a novel by T. H. White that was first published in 1958. Divided into four parts, it traces the evolution of the young Arthur from a reluctant, befuddled boy tutored by Merlin to a wise and just king. As he grapples with love, war, and the burdens of leadership, Arthur's story becomes an exploration of power, morality, and the enduring struggle for a utopian society. The Once and Future King has been adapted for the screen several times, most notably as the Disney film The Sword in the Stone in 1963.Â
