Dandelion provides much needed levity to both Geralt’s life and the book as a whole. He is gregarious and flirtatious, and he often finds himself in trouble for speaking without thinking. Even in the most dire of situations, he is incapable of staying quiet. This is fitting because he makes his living through his voice and words. In fact, he is famous for his touching lyrics and poetry. His lyricism illustrates certain aspects of the world within the novel as he waxes on about the environment around him, the people he encounters, and even the philosophical concerns of Geralt’s life as a witcher.  

In many ways, Dandelion serves to complement and contrast Geralt, making him an unlikely foil to the witcher. Where Geralt is stern, reserved, and cautious, Dandelion is playful, exuberant, and reckless. Despite their differences, they have a steadfast friendship that defines much of Geralt’s journey. Even Nenneke describes him as Geralt’s “exact opposite,” further cementing him as a point of contrast that provides insight into Geralt.
