Catherine is another of the play’s benevolent opportunists, making the most of circumstances as they break in her direction. At first, she is strongly supportive of the idea that Raina and Sergius marry. She finds Sergius to be a fitting future husband for her daughter, as he is a man whose bravery has been demonstrated on the battlefield. But once Sergius reveals that he has major flaws, Catherine and Petkoff are more than willing to support their daughter’s engagement to Bluntschli. This is especially true once Bluntschli indicates that he has recently come into a substantial fortune.
