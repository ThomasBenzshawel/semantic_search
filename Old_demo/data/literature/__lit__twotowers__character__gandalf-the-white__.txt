Gandalf is the supreme force of good in the novel, a worthy
				opponent of the evil Saruman and Sauron. Gandalf’s goodness and power
				are such as to make him seem a near-religious figure at times; indeed,
				there is Christian symbolism attached to the wizard, even though
				the mythology of The Lord of the Rings is primarily
				pagan. Wearing a white cloak and riding a white steed, Gandalf is
				associated with the Christian color of spiritual purity. In a distinctly Christ-like
				resurrection, the wizard has died and returned from the grave, having
				fallen to his death in the preceding volume of the novel. Gandalf
				has passed through the greatest trial of existence—that of death—and
				has survived with his powers enormously enhanced. Furthermore, the
				wizard’s timely arrival with military backup during the siege of
				Hornburg makes him seem almost a miracle worker.

However Christlike Gandalf may seem, though, he is no
				transcendent figure floating over the action. He maintains firm
				personal connections with all the characters, regardless of race
				or rank; he addresses even the lowliest members of the Fellowship
				by their full names and with great respect. Tolkien reminds us that
				even the immensely powerful Gandalf occasionally needs human help,
				as when the wizard asks Théoden to give him the horse Shadowfax. This
				human connection brings Gandalf down to earth, enabling us to identify
				with him more than we might have expected.
