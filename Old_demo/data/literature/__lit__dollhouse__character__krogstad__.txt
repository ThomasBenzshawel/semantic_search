Krogstad is the antagonist in A Doll’s House, but
he is not necessarily a villain. Though his willingness to allow
Nora’s torment to continue is cruel, Krogstad is not without sympathy
for her. As he says, “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like
me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.” He visits
Nora to check on her, and he discourages her from committing suicide.
Moreover, Krogstad has reasonable motives for behaving as he does:
he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children
from the hardships that come with a spoiled reputation. Unlike Torvald,
who seems to desire respect for selfish reasons, Krogstad desires
it for his family’s sake.

	Like Nora, Krogstad is a person who has been wronged
by society, and both Nora and Krogstad have committed the same crime: forgery
of signatures. Though he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was
relatively minor, but society has saddled him with the stigma of
being a criminal and prohibited him from moving beyond his past.
Additionally, Krogstad’s claim that his immoral behavior began when
Mrs. Linde abandoned him for a man with money so she could provide
for her family makes it possible for us to understand Krogstad as
a victim of circumstances. One could argue that society forced Mrs.
Linde away from Krogstad and thus prompted his crime. Though society’s
unfair treatment of Krogstad does not justify his actions, it does
align him more closely with Nora and therefore tempers our perception
of him as a despicable character.
