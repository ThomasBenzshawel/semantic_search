A New York City native, Shecker is the son of a rich and famous comedian. Constantly reminded of the space he occupies living in his father's shadow, he does not possess nearly the same comedic skills, and often futilely attempts to use humor to hide pain. The Bedwetters, however, do not care for his jokes and discourage him from recounting them. A gross overeater, Shecker attempts to eat his problems away. Unfortunately, this only worsens the situation, as he becomes the subject of significant ridicule, even from his own father. His parents also have a difficult marriage and he often finds himself in the middle of their squabbles, in which his mother and his father each manipulate him for their own ends.
