Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is a play by Tom Stoppard that was first performed in 1966. It is a tragicomedy that follows the titular characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as they navigate the events of the play. The play explores themes of fate, free will, and the nature of reality, and it is often seen as an example of the Theatre of the Absurd. It was adapted into a film in 1990 that was directed by Stoppard himself.
