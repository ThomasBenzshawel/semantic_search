While Jim and Ántonia are by far the most important figures
				in My Ántonia, one should not overlook Lena’s importance
				to Jim’s youth (the third book of the novel bears her name as the
				title, indicating the extent of her impact on his life). Cather
				conjures Lena to contrast sharply with Ántonia: while Ántonia possesses
				an independence that gives her quiet inner strength, Lena craves
				excitement and autonomy, refusing to marry any of the men who fall
				in love with her beauty and charisma. Her choice to live in San
				Francisco is nearly as extreme for someone from Black Hawk as Jim’s
				decision to move to New York.

It is no coincidence that Lena becomes important to Jim’s
				life at the moment he begins to transition out of childhood and
				into adulthood. Just as Ántonia comes to embody Jim’s memories of
				childhood innocence and purity, Lena, with her desire for sophistication and
				her precocious sexuality, comes to represent Jim’s emergence as a
				young adult. Tellingly, Jim fantasizes sexually about Lena in a
				way that he cannot about Ántonia. Even as a young man in Black Hawk, Jim
				already associates Ántonia with a lost past and invests her with an
				aura of emotional purity that precludes sex. Lena continues to become
				more important to Jim as he attends college, when they are both
				in Lincoln together. Though Jim never grants Lena an exalted place
				in his memory as he does to Ántonia, she is still a pivotal figure in
				his growth from childhood to adulthood, and, given the importance
				he gives her in his story, she may continue to figure more largely
				in Jim’s dream of the past than even Jim -himself realizes.
