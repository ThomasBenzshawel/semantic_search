Though younger than her sister, Nettie often acts as Celie’s
				protector. Nettie is highly intellectual and from an early age recognizes
				the value of education. However, even though Nettie is smart and
				ambitious, Mr. ______ effectively silences her by secretly hiding
				her letters from Celie. In her letters to Celie, Nettie writes that
				she is lonely, showing that like Celie, Nettie needs a sympathetic
				audience to listen to her thoughts and concerns.

	Critics have faulted Nettie’s letters for being digressive
				and boring in comparison to Celie’s. Although Nettie’s letters are
				indeed quite encyclopedic and contain less raw experience and emotion, they
				play an important role in the novel. As a black intellectual traveling
				the world in pursuit of “the uplift of black people everywhere,”
				Nettie has a vastly different experience from Celie. Yet her letters,
				which recount the problems Nettie encounters in Africa, broaden
				the novel’s scope and show that oppression—of women by men, of blacks
				by whites, and even of blacks by blacks—is universal. The imperial,
				racial, and cultural conflict and oppression Nettie encounters in
				Africa parallel the smaller-scale abuses and hardships that Celie
				experiences in Georgia.
