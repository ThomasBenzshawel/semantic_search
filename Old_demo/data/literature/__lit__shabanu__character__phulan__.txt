Phulan is older than Shabanu by two years. She is a beautiful girl, and her beauty brings her great pleasure. She looks forward single-mindedly to her future as a wife, while at the same time quakes with fear and sadness at the prospect of leaving behind her childhood home.

Phulan serves as a foil for Shabanu. In many ways, Phulan is a model Cholistani girl: sweet, pretty, obedient, and unquestioning. On the other hand, Phulan is vain, enjoys being pampered, often does not consider the implications and possible outcomes of her actions, and, when she forgets her love for Hamir so soon after his death, proves somewhat inconstant. Phulan is a sweet, harmless girl for whom Shabanu feels responsible.
