A month later, Aza sees on the news that Russell’s body was found. Aza texts Davis to let him know that she and Daisy did not tip off the police. Davis responds that he knows it wasn’t them. Davis and Noah had called in the tip anonymously so they could find out for sure the fate of their father. Aza feels that she should have waited to tell Davis about his father so he and his brother would have been able to continue living off of the family fortune before everything was left to tuatara research, but her mom reminds her to be kind to herself. Aza texts Davis to ask him to hang out some time, but her never responds. 

Months later, Davis appears at Aza’s house to deliver a gift. He tells her that he is moving to Colorado with Noah. Aza opens the gift after Davis leaves and finds a painting of spirals. Aza’s perspective shifts to her future self, talking about how her current self does not know that life goes on. She speaks of going to college, finding a job, and seeing the ups and downs of her life. She says that she, a singular person that does exist, will go on even if she does not know it yet.
