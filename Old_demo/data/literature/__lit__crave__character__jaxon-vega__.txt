Jaxon's initial portrayal is mysterious and overtly dangerous. He’s a strong example of the classic “bad boy” trope found in many romance novels: he’s brooding, rude, and yet still inexplicably totally captivating to Grace. Yet, as the narrative progresses, it becomes clear that Jaxon is more than just a handsome face and an unpleasant attitude. As the novel progresses, his capacity for leadership and for personal restraint is tested time and again, forcing him to learn to control his emotions and think before he acts. The choices he makes—particularly in relation to Grace and the safety of Katmere Academy—show an arc of growth from a chilly, solitary, selfish figure into a thoughtful leader willing to put others before himself. 

Jaxon’s backstory is a very troubled one, deeply marred by tragedy and loss. After learning that his older brother Hudson planned to overthrow the other supernatural leaders and begin a new world order, Jaxon was forced to kill him. His mother, the Vampire Queen Delilah Vega, never forgave him. Hudson’s death has left him laden with grief and familial responsibilities that weigh heavily on his shoulders. He’s forced to step into a role that he never wanted as the new heir to the Vampire Throne. He has to navigate the difficulties of life as a teenage boy in high school, while also carrying the dual burdens of leadership and the expectation to uphold his aristocratic lineage. 

While Jaxon exudes a commanding presence and is often considered cold and grumpy by other students, his interactions with Grace reveal a vulnerability and sensitivity that was previously hidden. Crave explores the tension between his inherent vampire instincts—which compel him towards darkness, jealousy, and violence—and his intense desire to protect and cherish Grace. It doesn’t help that when he feels strong emotions he tends to set off earthquakes, as he is a powerful telekinetic. The evolving relationship between Jaxon and Grace is a very important part of his growth into adulthood. Through Grace’s eyes, we witness Jaxon’s protective instincts, thirst for control and tendency to lose his temper, but also the emergence of a capacity for love and loyalty that he wasn’t previously aware of. Their bond challenges Jaxon to confront his darker impulses and to consider the possibility that he might, one day, be able to live a happy and peaceful life.
