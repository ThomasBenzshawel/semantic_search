Before we meet Phoebe, Holden’s side of the story
is all we’ve been given. He implies that he is the only noble character
in a world of superficial and phony adults, and we must take him
at his word. There seems to be a simple dichotomy between the sweet
world of childhood innocence, where Holden wants to stay, and the
cruel world of shallow adult hypocrisy, where he’s afraid to go.
But Phoebe complicates his narrative. Instead of sympathizing with
Holden’s refusal to grow up, she becomes angry with him. Despite
being six years younger than her brother, Phoebe understands that
growing up is a necessary process; she also understands that Holden’s
refusal to mature reveals less about the outside world than it does
about himself. Next to Phoebe, Holden’s stunted emotional maturity
and stubborn outlook seem less charming and more foolish. Phoebe,
then, serves as a guide and surrogate for the audience. Because
she knows her brother better than we do, we trust her judgments
about him. Our allegiance to the narrator weakens slightly once
we hear her side of the story.

Phoebe makes Holden’s picture of childhood—of
children romping through a field of rye—seem oversimplified, an
idealized fantasy. Phoebe’s character challenges Holden’s view of
the world: she is a child, but she does not fit into Holden’s romanticized
vision of childlike innocence. Although she never explicitly states
it, Phoebe seems to realize that Holden’s bitterness toward the
rest of the world is really bitterness toward himself. She sees
that he is a deeply sad, insecure young man who needs love and support.
At the end of the book, when she shows up at the museum and demands
to come with him, she seems not so much to need Holden as to understand
that he needs her.
