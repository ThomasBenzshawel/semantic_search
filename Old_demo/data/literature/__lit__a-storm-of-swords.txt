A Storm of Swords is a fantasy novel written by George. R. R. Martin that was published in 2000. The third in Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords picks up where A Clash of Kings left off. Intricate, expansive, and magnificent in its storytelling, the novel is told from the points of view of twelve characters as it follows each of their perspectives as they grapple with various issues such as The War of the Five Kings, the tension between the wildlings beyond the wall and the Knight’s Watch whose duty is to protect the wall, and Daenerys Targaryen’s mission to reclaim her father’s stolen throne. Filled with magic, intrigue, political drama, and much more, A Song of Ice and Fire won the 2001 Locus and was nominated for many more awards. The third, fourth, and aspects of the fifth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones were adapted from A Storm of Swords.
