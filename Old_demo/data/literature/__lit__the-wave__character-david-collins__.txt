At the beginning of the story, Laurie, informed by her mother’s awareness, worries that David, her boyfriend and the running back for Gordon High’s football team, is a one-dimensional jock. However, as The Wave movement takes off, Laurie also sees that David is especially “idealistic.” Both of Laurie’s assessments are apt, however, as revealed after Mr. Ross shows a disturbing film about the Holocaust, and David’s predominant sensation is hunger. In addition, even with clear signs that The Wave is fascistic and evidence that the movement has brought harm, David continues to believe in the movement and remains blind to the harm it’s caused. He focuses solely on its promise to bring discipline and unity to Gordon High and its football team. Laurie knows that David is also deeply naïve, a characteristic proven when he insists the Holocaust was merely a part of history and its crimes couldn’t be repeated. Still, despite all of David’s flaws, his character experiences a great transformation. At the moment he pushes Laurie to the ground and demands she no longer speak out against The Wave, he realizes how dangerous the movement is and that the same type of fascistic behavior that swept through post–World War I Nazi Germany also swelled in Gordon High.
