At first glance, Gabriel appears to be a washed-up old
				vaquero, or cowboy, who lives in a state of nostalgic regret on
				a patch of barren land. Gabriel works a demeaning job, drinks himself
				into a stupor on a weekly basis, and frequently fights with his
				wife. But as the novel progresses, the depth and dignity of Gabriel’s
				relationship with the llano becomes clear. Even though he lives
				in a state of regret, he does so only out of his genuine fondness
				for the vaquero way of life. His choice to live on barren rather
				than fertile land results from his desire to be near the llano.
				His barren surroundings also support the idea that his family lives
				on the threshold of civilization and isolation. 

The family’s in-between state causes a great deal of conflict between
				Gabriel and his wife, María, a Catholic who would like to live in
				a civilized town. For the sake of María and his family, Gabriel leaves
				the llano, moves to town, and begins to attend church. Gabriel continually
				demonstrates maturity, equanimity, and self-sacrifice in this vein
				as the story progresses. María tries to force Antonio to follow
				her family’s tradition and become a priest, but Gabriel does not
				coax him to follow his background and become a vaquero. Instead,
				Gabriel wants Antonio to become a vaquero only if he chooses that
				lifestyle. At the conclusion of the novel, Gabriel volunteers to
				put aside the conflict with the Lunas and help Antonio make his
				own choice about his future. Like Antonio himself, Gabriel has a serious
				and inquisitive mind. He has suffered hardship and bad luck, but
				he continues to strive to do the right thing and to help the people
				he loves.
