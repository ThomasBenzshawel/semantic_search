Things Fall Apart by Nigerian author and poet Chinua Achebe, first published in 1958, is a seminal work in African literature. Set in pre-colonial Nigeria, the novel chronicles the life of Okonkwo, a proud Igbo warrior, as he navigates the shifting dynamics of his community. Achebe’s narrative masterfully captures the cultural richness of Igbo society, delving into its customs and traditions, spirituality, and social structures. As the arrival of European colonizers disrupts the traditional way of life, Okonkwo's world begins to unravel, symbolizing the broader impact of colonialism on African societies. The novel is a poignant exploration of the clash between tradition and change, offering a profound reflection on the consequences of cultural imperialism.

Historically, Things Fall Apart is situated in the context of the late colonial period, capturing the complexities and tensions of the encounter between African communities and European powers. Achebe’s work stands as a critique of European and American colonial narratives that often marginalized or misrepresented African perspectives. Beyond its historical significance, the novel remains relevant today, addressing themes of identity, power, and the enduring consequences of colonial legacies. Things Fall Apart has become a classic, not only in African literature but in global literary discourse, contributing to a more inclusive understanding of world history.

Achebe follow up Things Fall Apart with two more novels—No Longer at Ease (1960) and Arrow of God (1964)—and the works together consistitue his Africa Trilogy.
