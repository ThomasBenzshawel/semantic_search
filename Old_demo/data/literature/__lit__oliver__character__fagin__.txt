Although Dickens denied that anti-Semitism had influenced
				his portrait of Fagin, the Jewish thief’s characterization does
				seem to owe much to ethnic stereotypes. He is ugly, simpering, miserly,
				and avaricious. Constant references to him as “the Jew” seem to
				indicate that his negative traits are intimately connected to his
				ethnic identity. However, Fagin is more than a statement of ethnic
				prejudice. He is a richly drawn, resonant embodiment of terrifying
				villainy. At times, he seems like a child’s distorted vision of
				pure evil. Fagin is described as a “loathsome reptile” and as having
				“fangs such as should have been a dog’s or rat’s.” Other characters
				occasionally refer to him as “the old one,” a popular nickname for
				the devil. Twice, in Chapter 9 and again
				in Chapter 34, Oliver wakes up to find Fagin
				nearby. Oliver encounters him in the hazy zone between sleep and
				waking, at the precise time when dreams and nightmares are born
				from “the mere silent presence of some external object.” Indeed,
				Fagin is meant to inspire nightmares in child and adult readers
				alike. Perhaps most frightening of all, though, is Chapter 52,
				in which we enter Fagin’s head for his “last night alive.” The gallows, and
				the fear they inspire in Fagin, are a specter even more horrifying to
				contemplate than Fagin himself.
