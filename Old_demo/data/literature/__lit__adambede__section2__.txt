The narrator takes the reader to the home of Mr. Aldophous
					Irwine, the rector of Broxton, where Hayslope is located. Mr. Irwine
					is playing chess with his mother, Mrs. Irwine, a socialite. Mr.
					Irwine is a bachelor because he has chosen to take care of his mother
					and two unmarried sisters, one of whom is chronically ill, rather
					than have his own family. Joshua Rann, the cobbler and parish clerk
					of Hayslope, comes to see Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists
					and Dinah. In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will
					Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about
					Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine laughs off the insults and tells
					Rann to leave Maskery to his own business. As Rann is leaving, Captain
					Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask Mr. Irwine to go riding with him.
					Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landlord,
					Squire Donnithorne. Known throughout the village as “the young squire,”
					he is a dashing man who is staying at the Squire’s estate to recover
					from an injury in the army. Rann tells both Mr. Irwine and Captain
					Donnithorne about the death of Thias Bede, Adam’s father.

Dinah repairs linens at her aunt’s home, called Hall Farm.
					Mrs. Poyser, Dinah’s aunt, scolds the maid for being lazy, even
					though the maid has been very industrious all day. She laughs when
					reminiscing about how much Dinah looks like the aunt who raised
					her after her mother died. Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne arrive,
					and Captain Donnithorne asks Mrs. Poyser to show him her dairy.

Captain Donnithorne and Mrs. Poyser go to the dairy, where
					Captain Donnithorne first lays eyes on Hetty. A beautiful young
					girl, Hetty is the seventeen-year-old niece of Mr. Poyser. The Poysers took
					her in after she was orphaned, and she lives with them at Hall Farm
					and helps Mrs. Poyser with household chores. Captain Donnithorne
					flirts with Hetty, even going so far as to ask Mrs. Poyser to go
					get her small daughter, Totty, in order to have a few moments alone
					with Hetty. Hetty responds coquettishly to his advances. Captain
					Donnithorne asks Hetty when she will next be at the Chase, where
					Captain Donnithorne lives, and Hetty reveals her plans to visit
					a housekeeper at the estate the next day.

While the others are in the dairy, Mr. Irwine chats with
					Dinah and asks her how she became a preacher. Dinah explains that
					she was once going to a nearby village with a preacher when that
					preacher fell ill. Because she felt moved by God, she stood in for
					him and has been a preacher even since. She explains that she chooses
					to live in the rougher country around Snowfield because she is called
					to alleviate the suffering of those who live there. Dinah also reveals
					that she works in the mill in Snowfield. Mr. Irwine does not chastise Dinah
					for her beliefs but treats her gently. When Mr. Irwine tells Dinah
					about the death of Thias Bede, she tells Mrs. Poyser and Hetty.
					Hetty is unaffected by the news, but Dinah resolves to go visit Lisbeth
					to try to comfort her.

Chapters 7 and 8 display
					Hetty as Dinah’s foil by the way they each interact with men. The
					conversation between Captain Donnithorne and Hetty in chapter 7 directly
					contrasts with the conversation between Mr. Irwine and Dinah in
					chapter 8. Where Captain Donnithorne and
					Hetty speak of nothing in particular and yet intend another meaning
					entirely, Mr. Irwine and Dinah speak of very personal things and
					are straightforward and unflinching. From the very beginning, then,
					Dinah and Hetty are set in opposition. Dinah focuses on others,
					and she is serious and calm. Hetty focuses entirely on herself and
					is flirtatious and capricious. Her lack of concern on learning of
					Thias’s death, when she should care more than Dinah because she
					is at least friends with Adam and knows he loves her, suggests in
					Hetty a deep selfishness that contrasts with Dinah’s desire to help
					others. Dinah and Hetty also share several similarities, which heighten
					the contrast between the two of them. Both are intensely beautiful
					women who were orphaned and raised by an aunt. They are of similar
					ages and class, and both are single. Both will come to have a very
					important role in the life of Adam Bede, although how they feel
					toward him will be different. The differences in the characters
					of Hetty and Dinah lead to their different ends and make Hetty the
					closest thing the novel has to a villain, whereas Dinah is its heroine.

Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne are also in contrast
					with each other, despite superficial similarities. Both men are
					single, but Mr. Irwine behaves chastely and with propriety toward
					Dinah, a beautiful woman, whereas Captain Donnithorne flirts shamelessly with
					Hetty. They are from the upper class, but both are poor because
					the Squire does not give them more money. Mr. Irwine takes a genuine
					interest in the villagers, however, whereas Captain Donnithorne
					thinks of them more like amusing children. Both men seek to do good
					for others, but there is a critical difference in their attempts
					at charity. Where Captain Donnithorne desires to be thought
						of as one who does good, Mr. Irwine actually just does good wherever
					he can, regardless of the recognition involved. Mr. Irwine cares
					for his ailing spinster sister when no one else does. Captain Donnithorne
					largely ignores his spinster aunt. The presence of both Captain
					Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine in the novel is important because without
					Mr. Irwine, the novel might merely be a critique of the upper class.
					With Mr. Irwine’s presence, however, Eliot makes it clear that good
					and bad are found in the upper classes of society.

The characters in Adam Bede speak with
					the peculiar dialect of the region at that time, but each of their
					accents also reflects their class and their self-perception. Adam,
					for example, speaks clear and strong English when he is in the presence
					of Captain Donnithorne, Mr. Irwine, or most of the villagers. At
					home, however, his speech lapses into “peasant speech,” which is
					more heavily accented and less grammatically proper. This shift
					reflects his desire to please his mother, as the narrator tells
					the reader, but it also reflects the fundamental fact about Adam:
					although he was raised a peasant, and the marks of poverty and a
					simple country upbringing are always on him, he has largely outpaced
					his more simple-minded family. He belongs both to the world of the
					lower class, in terms of his morality and his beliefs, and to the
					world of the upper class, in terms of his intellect and sophistication.
					Mr. Massey, the schoolteacher, speaks relatively clear English,
					but he says everything twice. This idiosyncrasy may stem from his
					life as a teacher of poor students. In his professional career,
					he must always repeat everything he says. Mrs. Poyser has the thickest
					accent in the novel, and her wisdom matches her homespun knowledge.
					Her idioms are usually original, and their insight is profound.
					Her character, like her accent, represents the wisdom of the country
					peasant in the novel. Eliot’s representation of the accent is phonetic,
					so that any difficulties the readers many have with the accents
					can be resolved by sounding out the words. The different accents
					are important because they reflect the characters’ true natures.
