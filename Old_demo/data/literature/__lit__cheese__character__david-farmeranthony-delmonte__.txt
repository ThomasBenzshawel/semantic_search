Anthony was an upright journalist who bravely investigated the corrupt government. After his reluctant identity change, Anthony became David and lived in fear of being found out. David takes the job of an insurance agent, which is particularly ironic: David's duty is to provide protection for people in the event of an accident, while the government provides protection to David. David handles the relocation better than Louise, and he stoically accepts Grey's orders for his new life, while holding out hope that he will return to journalism. Every so often his fa√ßade cracks and he exposes his sadness. The one positive effect of Adam's discovery of the truth is that David and his son grow closer. However, David makes sure to withhold certain information from his testimony from Adam in case he is ever questioned.
