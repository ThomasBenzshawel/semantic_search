Arguably the most colorful and likable character in For
					Whom the Bell Tolls, Pilar embodies the earthiness, strength,
				and wisdom of the Spanish peasantry. A large, robust, part-gypsy
				woman, Pilar exercises great influence over the band of guerrilleros—in
				fact, we quickly become aware that Pablo leads the band in name
				only. The strong and stable Pilar provides the motivating force
				behind many of the novel’s events. She pushes Robert Jordan and
				Maria’s romance, commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters,
				and organizes the guerrilleros’ brief alliance with El Sordo. She
				acts as the support structure for the camp as she unites the band
				of guerrilla fighters into a family, cooks for all, and sews Robert
				Jordan’s packs. In short, Pilar manipulates the most important characters
				in For Whom the Bell Tolls and sets in place many
				of the encounters that drive the plot.

Pilar, though practical, often relies on intuitive, mystical,
				gypsy folk wisdom. Shrewd and worldly-wise, she claims a deep connection
				to the primitive forces of fate. She claims to be able to smell death,
				and she describes the smell in repulsively naturalistic detail. She
				reads palms and interprets sexual experiences. Despite Robert Jordan’s
				cynicism, Pilar’s predictions do come true. Pilar exhibits the inevitable
				sadness that comes with knowledge: “Neither bull force nor bull
				courage lasted, she knew now, and what did last? I last. . . . But
				for what?” In the end, the only aspect of Pilar’s personality that
				seems not to show wisdom is her unswerving commitment to and belief
				in the Republican side, which ultimately loses the war.
