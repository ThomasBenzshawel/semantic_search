In direct contrast to Roark, Ellsworth Monkton
				Toohey embodies everything evil about mankind. He is irredeemably
				corrupt and evil. Whereas Roark never tries to win friends or influence
				people, Toohey’s power lies entirely in his ability to control weaker
				minds and souls. Toohey’s evil is as ingrained as Roark’s goodness—Toohey
				learns the practice of manipulation as a child, and turns it into
				an art by the time he graduates from college. By making people feel
				small and guilty, Toohey shakes their faith in their own abilities
				and then assumes control of their lives. Toohey preaches selflessness
				and ignorance of the ego to force people to act with humble mediocrity.
				Toohey has no talents of his own, so he makes himself excellent
				by grinding down his followers. His tactics frequently evoke those
				of Joseph Stalin, the former Russian revolutionary who emerged as
				Russia’s dictator.
