Neveu’s presence in the novel embodies the Chinese idea
				of yin and yang, or two complementary forces that work together
				in harmony. From Langdon and Teabing, Sophie learns that pagan religions
				and the Priory valued balance between male and female. Sophie and Langdon
				form the male and female halves of a single protagonist, and their
				goals never diverge. In this way, they echo Teabing’s and Langdon’s
				ideas about the partnership of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. In their
				view, the male and the female worked together toward a goal, without
				the female being subordinate to the male in any way. 

Both Sophie and Langdon, like the Mona Lisa,
				exhibit male and female traits: for example, Langdon’s headiness
				is balanced by Sophie’s real world know-how. Sophie is quick-witted,
				agile, devious when she needs to be, and physically assertive, as
				when she helps to disable Silas in the chateau. But at the same
				time, she is caring and compassionate. She feels the loss of her
				family deeply and mourns the death of her grandfather. Both brilliant
				and sexually attractive, Sophie combines a masculine toughness with
				typically feminine qualities.
