A sniveler and incorrigible beggar, the prisoner Fetyukov
				is the opposite of the dignified and self-reliant Shukhov. While
				Shukhov earns extra bread by breaking his back at the Power Station
				work site, Fetyukov gets extra bread by playing on others’ pity.
				Surprisingly, given the limited food and tobacco resources of the
				camp, Fetyukov does quite well for himself—he is often seen hoarding
				the little bits that have been handed to him. But Solzhenitsyn criticizes Fetyukov
				for his lack of dignity, which sets him apart from almost everyone
				else in the novel, even the cruel Volkovoy and the starving old
				prisoner who sits near Shukhov at dinner. In a sense, Fetyukov is a
				degraded version of Tsezar. Whereas Tsezar desires finer thingss because
				he enjoys quality, Fetyukov seems to hoard what he can merely for
				the sake of hoarding.
