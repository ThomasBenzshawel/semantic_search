Nausea is a novel by French existentialist philosopher and author Jean-Paul Sartre that was first published in 1938. Although it was the author’s first novel and not meant as a philosophical tract, Nausea is remarkable for the degree to which it encapsulates many key tenets of Sartre’s mature existentialist philosophy that he would later explicate in his groundbreaking philosophical treatise Being and Nothingness (1944) and elsewhere. Today, Nausea endures as one of the most significant works of “philosophical fiction” produced in the 20th century.
