Howards End, published in 1910, is a novel by E. M. Forster that explores the social, economic, and philosophical tensions between three families in turn-of-the-century England. The novelâ€™s plot centers around the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and their relationships with the wealthy Wilcox family and the working-class Basts. Howards End is a work of modernist literature that grapples with the changing social landscape of early 20th-century England and the tension between the individual and society. In 1992, the novel was the basis of a film adaptation directed by James Ivory and starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.
