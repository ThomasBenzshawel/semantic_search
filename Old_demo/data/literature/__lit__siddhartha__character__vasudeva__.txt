Vasudeva, the enlightened ferryman, is the guide who finally
				leads Siddhartha to enlightenment. Siddhartha first meets Vasudeva
				after leaving Gotama and Govinda and immediately notices Vasudeva’s serenity.
				Although Vasudeva lives within this world, his presence seems to
				transcend it, and all who meet him feel his divine, enlightened
				energy. He does not boast about his power or wisdom but simply credits
				all knowledge he has to the river. His primary action, other than
				ferrying passengers across the river, seems to be listening to whatever
				wisdom the river imparts to him. He is such a powerful figure that
				when a desperate, suicidal Siddhartha, convinced he’ll never reach
				enlightenment, encounters Vasudeva a second time, he asks to become
				Vasudeva’s apprentice. In a way, Siddhartha relies on Vasudeva to
				save his life.

	Vasudeva does not teach Siddhartha a complicated philosophical belief
				system, only that he should learn from the river and allow it to explain
				its wisdom. Throughout Siddhartha’s spiritual progression, Vasudeva
				keeps him moving in the right direction by prompting him to listen
				to the river whenever he has questions or doubts. In a bittersweet
				ending to their time together, Siddhartha’s achievement of Nirvana
				coincides with the end of Vasudeva’s time on the river and on earth.
				Vasudeva, who has literally and figuratively ferried Siddhartha
				to enlightenment, can now leave the earth, with Siddhartha taking
				over as ferryman. Vasudeva will live on in Siddhartha’s own enlightenment
				and teachings. 

Vasudeva is a name for Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu,
				one of the powerful gods in a Hindu trinity, and means “he who lives
				in all thoughts, and who lives in all people.” He is the most godlike
				figure within the book, yet he acts with surprising humility.
