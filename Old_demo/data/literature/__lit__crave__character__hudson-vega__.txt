Hudson Vega is a very important character in Crave, but he only actually appears in person in the novel’s final pages. This is because he is initially thought to be deceased, a fact that significantly shapes both the narrative and Jaxon's character. His presumed death casts a long shadow over the students at Katmere Academy and is a source of grief and guilt, particularly for Jaxon. Hudson was smart, talented, and influential, with the supernatural ability to make other people follow him and do his bidding. He believed that vampires were the most superior beings on earth, and wanted to subdue and dominate all other groups when he came to the Vampire Throne.  

Even in death, Hudson is a pivotal character, and though he’s not physically present for most of the book, he comes up in almost every chapter. The legacy of his actions, and the memories others like Lia Tanaka have of him, continue to influence the events at Katmere Academy. His death is the catalyst for much of the conflict within the supernatural community, including the rift between shifters and vampires. Jaxon is constantly reminded of his murderous actions every time a conflict arises, especially as characters like Flint like to remind him of Hudson’s death in times of strife. 

We learn at the end of the novel that Lia Tanaka had been plotting to sacrifice Grace and resurrect Hudson; it’s implied that he and Lia had a loving, if obsessive relationship, and Lia believes in his goals so much that she’s willing to commit murder to bring him back. Hudson returns with a vengeance, swinging an enormous sword at Jaxon’s head. Even though Hudson doesn’t succeed in murdering his brother, disappearing after Grace blocks the blow, Jaxon cannot let go of the idea that Grace remains in her stone form because Hudson is forcing her to.
