Ying-ying was born in the year of the Tiger, a creature
				of force and stealth. However, when her nursemaid tells her that
				girls should be meek and passive, Ying-ying begins to lose her sense
				of autonomous will. Furthermore, at an early age Ying-ying’s profound
				belief in fate and her personal destiny led to a policy of passivity
				and even listlessness. Always listening to omens and signs, she
				never paid attention to her inner feelings. Because she believed
				that she was “destined” to marry a vulgar family friend, she did
				nothing to seriously prevent the marriage, and even came to love
				her husband, as if against her will. When he died, she allowed the
				American Clifford St. Clair to marry her because she sensed that
				he was her destiny as well. For years she let Clifford mistranslate
				her clipped sentences, her gestures, and her silences.

Only after Ying-ying realizes that she has passed on her
				passivity and fatalism to her daughter Lena does she take any initiative
				to change. Seeing her daughter in an unhappy marriage, she urges
				her to take control. She tells Lena her story for the first time,
				hoping that she might learn from her mother’s own failure to take
				initiative and instead come to express her thoughts and feelings.
				Lena, too, was born in the year of the Tiger, and Ying-ying hopes
				that her daughter can live up to their common horoscope in a way
				that she herself failed to do. Moreover, in this belief in astrology
				Ying-ying finds a sort of positive counterpart to her earlier, debilitating
				superstitions and fatalism, for it is a belief not in the inevitability
				of external events but in the power of an internal quality.
