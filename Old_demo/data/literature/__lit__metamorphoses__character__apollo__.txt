Ovid characterizes Apollo as a god of foolish and ineffectual
				passions. The son of Jupiter and the god of the sun, Apollo is a
				hothead. His strong emotions often get the best of him, making him
				look and act foolish. In Book I, his lust for Daphne leads him to
				caress and kiss herâ€”even after she has been turned into a tree.
				In Book II, he allows his son, Phaeton, to ride his chariot, which
				almost destroys the whole world. In the same book, he kills his
				lover, Coronis, in a fit of fury. He ultimately regrets this murderous
				act. Apollo is not only tempestuous but also inept. Although he
				is the god of healing he is not able to help anyone. He fails in
				his attempt to heal Hyacinthus, his boy lover, and he does nothing
				to drive away the plague in Rome.
