Dmitri is the most turbulent of the three brothers. Passionate,
				headstrong, and reckless, he combines Alyosha’s good heart with
				Fyodor Pavlovich’s heedless sensuality. Dmitri has lived a life
				torn between sin and redemption. Unlike Alyosha, Dmitri is dominated
				by his passions, but unlike Fyodor Pavlovich, he feels genuine remorse
				for the sins he has committed and gradually comes to hope that his
				soul can be redeemed through suffering. Because Dmitri is the character most
				poised between animalism and spiritual redemption, he often represents
				the plight of humanity itself in the novel. When he is arrested
				for the murder of Fyodor Pavlovich, the question of his guilt or
				innocence becomes a crucial question about human nature—whether
				it is founded on good or evil. Dmitri is not only innocent of the
				crime, he undergoes an ardent spiritual conversion in prison and
				emerges from his trial a stronger, better person, prepared to live
				a life of goodness and to do penance for his sins. Through Dmitri’s
				redemption and Ivan’s breakdown, Dostoevsky thus concludes the novel
				by rejecting doubt and skepticism in favor of faith and love. Dmitri’s
				redemption represents the novel’s optimistic conclusion about the
				nature of mankind.
