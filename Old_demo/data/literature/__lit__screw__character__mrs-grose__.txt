An illiterate servant at Bly, Mrs. Grose provides the
				governess with open ears and loyal support. Although the governess
				thinks her simple minded and slow witted, Mrs. Grose knows more
				of the story than the governess fathoms and is as capable of piecing
				things together as is the governess, though slower to leap to dire
				conclusions. Although Mrs. Grose is the source for most of the governess’s
				information, the governess does not take her words at face value
				or ask Mrs. Grose for her opinions. Instead, the governess uses
				Mrs. Grose as a “receptacle of lurid things.” The governess
				frequently attempts to seize moments alone with Mrs. Grose so that
				she can try out her latest speculations. Mrs. Grose is usually skeptical
				of these speculations, but the governess takes Mrs. Grose’s incredulity
				for astonished belief. Like the reader, Mrs. Grose is willing to
				hear the governess out but doesn’t necessarily agree with her logic
				or conclusions.
