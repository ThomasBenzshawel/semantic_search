Mr. Knightley serves as the novel’s model of good sense.
				From his very first conversation with Emma and her father in Chapter 1,
				his purpose—to correct the excesses and missteps of those around him—is
				clear. He is unfailingly honest but tempers his honesty with tact
				and kindheartedness. Almost always, we can depend upon him to provide
				the correct evaluation of the other characters’ behavior and personal
				worth. He intuitively understands and kindly makes allowances for
				Mr. Woodhouse’s whims; he is sympathetic and protective of the women
				in the community, including Jane, Harriet, and Miss Bates; and,
				most of all, even though he frequently disapproves of her behavior,
				he dotes on Emma.

	Knightley’s love for Emma—the one emotion he cannot govern fully—leads
				to his only lapses of judgment and self-control. Before even meeting
				Frank, Knightley decides that he does not like him. It gradually
				becomes clear that Knightley feels jealous—he does not welcome a
				rival. When Knightley believes Emma has become too attached to Frank,
				he acts with uncharacteristic impulsiveness in running away to London.
				His declaration of love on his return bursts out uncontrollably,
				unlike most of his prudent, well-planned actions. Yet Knightley’s
				loss of control humanizes him rather than making him seem like a
				failure.

	Like Emma, Knightley stands out in comparison to his
				peers. His brother, Mr. John Knightley, shares his clear-sightedness
				but lacks his unfailing kindness and tact. Both Frank and Knightley
				are perceptive, warm-hearted, and dynamic; but whereas Frank uses
				his intelligence to conceal his real feelings and invent clever
				compliments to please those around him, Knightley uses his intelligence
				to discern right moral conduct. Knightley has little use for cleverness for
				its own sake; he rates propriety and concern for others more highly.
