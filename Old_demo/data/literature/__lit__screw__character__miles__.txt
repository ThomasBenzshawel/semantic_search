Miles might be either a cunning and deceitful plaything
				of ghosts or merely an innocent, unusually well-mannered young boy.
				The governess repeatedly changes her mind on the matter, leaving
				Miles’s true character in question. When the governess first meets
				Miles, she is struck by his “positive fragrance of purity” and the sense
				that he has known nothing but love. She finds herself excusing him
				for any potential mishap because he is too beautiful to misbehave.
				Yet she also senses a disturbing emptiness in Miles, an impersonality
				and lack of history, as though he is less than real. 

Once the governess begins having her supernatural encounters,
				she comes to believe that Miles is plotting evil deeds with his
				ghostly counterpart, Quint, and indeed Miles does exhibit strange
				behavior. For example, he plans an incident so that the governess
				will think him “bad,” and he steals the letter she wrote to his
				uncle. Mrs. Grose tells us that Peter Quint was a bad influence
				on him, but we have no way to measure the extent or precise nature
				of this influence, and Miles’s misdeeds may be nothing more than
				childish pranks. The fact that Miles is otherwise unusually pleasant
				and well behaved suggests that the sinister quality of his behavior exists
				only in the governess’s mind. The governess eventually decides that
				Miles must be full of wickedness, reasoning that he is too “exquisite”
				to be anything else, a conclusion she bases only on her own subjective impressions
				and conjectures.
