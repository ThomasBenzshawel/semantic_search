Simon Peter is one of the most sympathetic characters
				in the entire New Testament. Peter is determined to be Jesus’s best
				disciple, but prematurely thinks he understands what it means to
				follow Jesus. Peter does not believe Jesus’s prediction that he will
				deny having known Jesus, but Peter’s eagerness is immature, and
				he does end up denying his friendship to Jesus during the terrifying
				series of events surrounding the trial and crucifixion. Peter realizes
				his mistake and weeps bitterly. He is forgiven, and remains the
				rock upon which Jesus says he will build his church. Peter is a
				model of faithful discipleship. To this day, the Catholic Church
				claims apostolic succession from this very Peter, whose faith was
				as solid as a rock, but who was also at times overeager, afraid,
				and all too human.
