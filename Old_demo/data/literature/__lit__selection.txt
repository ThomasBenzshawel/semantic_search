The first volume of a five-book series that has since expanded, The Selection by Kiera Cass hit The New York Times Best Sellers list soon after its publication in 2012. In the story, which takes place 300 years in the future, sixteen-year-old America Singer is one of 35 young women chosen to compete for the heart and hand of the crown prince of Illéa. Equal parts dystopian fiction, royal romance, and reality-television competition, America’s story continues in The Elite, The One, The Heir, and The Crown.
