Cosette, like Valjean, grows up in an atmosphere of poverty
				and fear, but she is rescued from this life before her innocence
				gives way to cynicism. Though she spends a number of years under
				the tyrannical care of the Thénardiers, she never adopts their cruel
				views, which indicates that she possesses a fundamental decency
				and goodness that they lack. Once Valjean takes charge of Cosette’s
				upbringing, she quickly transforms from a dirty, unhappy child into
				a lovely, well-educated young woman. For Hugo, this transformation
				is so natural that he does not even bother to walk us through it
				and instead skips several years ahead.

Though she is obedient and fiercely loyal to her adoptive
				father, Cosette also has her own personality, which emerges as she
				enters adolescence and begins to hunger for a less sheltered life.
				In this period of their lives, Valjean’s role temporarily changes
				from Cosette’s savior to her jailer. Cosette’s ability to truly
				love Marius, however, is due in large part to Valjean, who has taught
				her to trust and love. In the end, Cosette remains true to her upbringing,
				and her love for Marius becomes her way of applying to her own life
				what she has learned from Valjean.
