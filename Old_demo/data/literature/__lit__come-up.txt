Published in February 2019, Angie Thomas’ On the Come Up is a coming-of-age novel set in Garden Heights, the same fictional neighborhood as Thomas’ previous novel, The Hate U Give. On the Come Up tells the story of 16-year-old Bri, an aspiring rapper whose song about security guard brutality at her school goes viral. An unflinching look at racial stereotypes, fame, and the complexities of familial love, the novel was nominated for a Carnegie Medal for Young Adult Literature and was adapted into a feature film in 2022.
