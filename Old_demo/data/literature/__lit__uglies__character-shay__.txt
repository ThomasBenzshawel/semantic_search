Shay’s nickname is “Skinny,” which refers to one of her more prominent physical “flaws”—her gawkiness. Shay is proud, however, of her imperfect features. Unlike Tally, Shay is an independent thinker and is highly skeptical of what her society says about beauty. She impresses upon Tally that the only reason Tally finds herself flawed is because she was taught that she was ugly—not because she actually is. 

When Shay first meets Tally, she is impressed with Tally’s daredevil stunts and considers her a fellow risk-taking “comrade.” Tally, however, isn’t as much of a risk-taker as she portends—the only reason she bungee jumped off the building the night she met Shay was out of desperation. Shay, in reality, is the more risk-taking of the two. When Tally challenges her by accusing Shay of being scared of growing up, Shay decides to take the leap and escape to the Smoke, something she backed out of doing a few months prior when her friends tried to get her to go. Shay is steadfast, loyal, adventurous, and trail-blazing. Shay’s decision to go to the Smoke sets into motion the plot of the novel. When she is turned into a Pretty against her will at the end of the novel, she inspires one last brave act by Tally—Tally’s sacrifice to save her.
