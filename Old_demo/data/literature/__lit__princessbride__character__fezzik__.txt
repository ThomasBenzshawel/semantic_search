Vizzini uses Fezzik, the strongest man alive, for criminal purposes. As an especially large child in Turkey, his parents took him to fight against champions, first locally, then all over the continent. Fezzik hated the sport of fighting but didn't want to lose his parents' affection by refusing. As a matter of fact, it is Fezzik's mother who, when Fezzik protests that fighting will hurt, says the famous words: "Life is pain. Anyone who says different is selling something." Fezzik, although excellent at following instructions, is very bad at remembering them, so Inigo often makes up rhymes that he can repeat to keep Vizzini's rules straight. He is fretful, fair, loyal to Inigo, and an excellent follower, since we are told many times that his only drive in life is not to be left alone.
