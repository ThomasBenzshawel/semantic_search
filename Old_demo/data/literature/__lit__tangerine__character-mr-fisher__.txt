Mr. Fisher has to step in to defend the Department of Civil Engineering on behalf of his corrupt boss shortly after he arrives on the job as civil engineer after a sinkhole collapses in the community. He manages to take command of the situation, but in several scenes, he still struggles to hold things together. Mr. Fisher’s oversight of the muck fires and the insurance nightmare they pose is just one of several issues Mrs. Fisher realizes he’s overlooked moving his family to Florida, showing him to be just as oblivious to certain important details as Mrs. Fisher.
