Hermione’s character develops significantly over the course
				of the story and sheds light on Harry’s character as well. At the
				outset, she is an annoying perfectionist, a goody-two-shoes who
				has read all the books for her classes in advance, has learned all
				about Hogwarts, and never breaks the rules. When she first speaks
				to Harry on the train ride to school, she is eager to impress him
				with her knowledge, whereas Harry only wants to make friends. Her
				intellectual talents are indeed worthy of pride, as we find out
				later when she scores 112 percent on her
				final exam. But we sense that her show-off side is a defense against
				her feelings of inferiority, because she comes from a Muggle family
				and, like Harry, is unfamiliar with the wizard world. In both Hermione
				and Harry we see that learning wizardry requires a great deal of
				social adjustment and self-confidence.

	Hermione’s development into a likable character and a
				friend begins in the troll episode, when Harry and Ron are reprimanded for
				trying to save her from the monster and she coolly delivers a bold-faced
				lie to the teacher. The little girl who has been abiding by all
				the school rules now dares to lie to her superiors, and a new friendship
				is born. Hermione’s decision to support her friends rather than
				obey the rules showcases what is perhaps truly valuable about Harry’s
				Hogwarts experience. The school teaches him not just facts from
				books and how to follow procedures, but also—and perhaps more important—loyalty,
				compassion for others, and solidarity.
