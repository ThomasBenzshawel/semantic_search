A sensitive child, James is gripped by a love for his
				mother that is as overpowering and complete as his hatred for his
				father. He feels a murderous rage against Mr. Ramsay, who, he believes,
				delights in delivering the news that there will be no trip to the
				lighthouse. But James grows into a young man who shares many of
				his father’s characteristics, the same ones that incited such anger
				in him as a child. When he eventually sails to the lighthouse with
				his father, James, like Mr. Ramsay, is withdrawn, moody, and easily
				offended. His need to be praised, as noted by his sister Cam, mirrors
				his father’s incessant need for sympathy, reassurance, and love.
				Indeed, as they approach the lighthouse, James considers his father’s
				profile and recognizes the profound loneliness that stamps both
				of their personalities. By the time the boat lands, James’s attitude
				toward his father has changed considerably. As he softens toward
				Mr. Ramsay and comes to accept him as he is, James, like Lily, who
				finishes her painting on shore at that very moment, achieves a rare,
				fleeting moment in which the world seems blissfully whole and complete.
