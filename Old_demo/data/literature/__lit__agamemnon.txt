Agamemnon is a tragedy by Aeschylus that was first performed around 458 BCE. Known as the “father of tragedy,” Aeschylus wrote Agamemnon as the first play of his trilogy The Oresteia—followed by The Libation Bearers and The Eumenides. Of the plays in the trilogy, Agamemnon contains the strongest command of language and characterization. The poetry is magnificent and moving, with skillful portrayal of major and minor characters alike.
