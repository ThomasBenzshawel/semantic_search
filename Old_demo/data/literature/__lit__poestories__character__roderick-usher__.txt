As one of the two surviving members of the Usher family
				in “The Fall of the House of Usher,” Roderick is one of Poe’s character
				doubles, or doppelgangers. Roderick is intellectual and bookish,
				and his twin sister, Madeline, is ill and bedridden. Roderick’s
				inability to distinguish fantasy from reality resembles his sister’s
				physical weakness. Poe uses these characters to explore the philosophical
				mystery of the relationship between mind and body. With these twins,
				Poe imagines what would happen if the connection between mind and body
				were severed and assigned to separate people. The twin imagery and
				the incestuous history of the Usher line establish that Roderick
				is actually inseparable from his sister. Although mind and body
				are separated, they remain dependent on each other for survival.
				This interdependence causes a chain reaction when one of the elements
				suffers a breakdown. Madeline’s physical death coincides with the
				collapse of both Roderick’s sanity and the Ushers’ mansion.
