Robert E. Lee, the commander of the Confederate army,
				was one of the most beloved men in the American South, the darling
				of Virginia society. Lee is fifty-seven years old at the time of
				the Battle of Gettysburg, and has less than a decade to live. He
				is having heart trouble, which will one day kill him. Some historians
				have speculated that Lee may have suffered a mild heart attack during
				the Battle of Gettysburg, and Shaara works from that idea. Lee is
				a brilliant tactician, but his traditional ideas frequently conflict
				with the more visionary policies of Longstreet, a Confederate general
				who constantly advises a defensive position.

	Shaara characterizes Lee as a wise old man, a brilliant
				commander who knows he is nearing the end of his career. Lee fervently holds
				on to the traditional ways of combat even while recognizing the
				importance of Longstreet’s newer ideas. Lee inspires his troops—even
				as the wounded soldiers stagger back from Pickett’s Charge, they beg
				him to let them attack again. Lee’s presence alone helps keep Confederate
				morale high. But Lee’s confidence in his army leads him to overestimate
				his men, causing the disaster of Pickett’s Charge.
