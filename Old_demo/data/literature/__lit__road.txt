The Road, Cormac McCarthyâ€™s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, was published in 2006. The story chronicles a father and son traveling the broken roadways of a post-apocalyptic world. The utter destruction of the natural environment and subsequent lawless, grotesque behavior of the survivors is described through the intimate perspective of an unshakable bond between father and son. The novel met with critical acclaim for its dark, elegiac style and vivid, poetic language. The Road was adapted into a film of the same name in 2009.
