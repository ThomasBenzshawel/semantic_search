The Woman Warrior is a memoir by Maxine Hong Kingston that was first published in 1976. With the subtitle Memoirs of a Childhood among Ghosts, the work uses a postmodern mix of memoir and fictional Chinese folktales as tells the stories of the important women in Kingston’s life. Kingston followed up The Woman Warrior with China Men (1980). Kingston followed up the book with China Men, a second memoir that focuses on Kingston's father, and thus completes the picture of Kingston’s childhood.
