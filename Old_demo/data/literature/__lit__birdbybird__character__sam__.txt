At the time of Bird by Bird’s publication,
				Lamott’s son Sam is between three and four years old. He is a clever,
				precocious child who interacts well with others. Though Lamott confesses
				that parenthood can sometimes drive her crazy, it is clear that
				she adores Sam. Many of her writing methods are directly inspired
				by her desire to leave him an inheritance of memories and experiences. Sam’s
				creative instincts are encouraged by Lamott, who finds wisdom in
				his comments, such as, “It smells like the moon.” Sam’s personality
				is most evident in his interaction with Brice, the severely damaged
				baby of Lamott’s friends. Sam shows great tenderness toward the
				baby. After Brice dies, Sam is calm about seeing his corpse. As
				Lamott portrays him, Sam has wisdom beyond his years.
