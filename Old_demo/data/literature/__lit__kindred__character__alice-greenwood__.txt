Alice doesn’t want to accept her life as Rufus’s sex slave. She understands what Rufus has done to her, and she longs to hate him. Against her will, however, she finds herself growing used to him, and even becoming his partner. She hates herself for her failure to live in a perpetual state of rage. Alice is Dana’s foil; she is sometimes vicious to Dana simply because she needs a handy outlet for her anger. At the same time, Alice is Dana’s twin. She shows us what Dana’s life might have been like had Dana been born into the world she sometimes visits.
