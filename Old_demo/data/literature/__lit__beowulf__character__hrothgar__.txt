Hrothgar, the aged ruler of the Danes who accepts Beowulf’s
				help in the first part of the story, aids Beowulf’s development
				into maturity. Hrothgar is a relatively static character, a force
				of stability in the social realm. Although he is as solidly rooted
				in the heroic code as Beowulf is, his old age and his experience
				with both good and ill fortune have caused him to develop a more
				reflective attitude toward heroism than Beowulf possesses. He is
				aware of both the privileges and the dangers of power, and he warns
				his young protégé not to give in to pride and always to remember
				that blessings may turn to grief. Hrothgar’s meditations on heroism
				and leadership, which take into account a hero’s entire life span
				rather than just his valiant youth, reveal the contrast between
				youth and old age that forms the turning point in Beowulf’s own
				development.
