Tall, skinny, and rebellious, fourteen-year-old Lawrence Teft originates from Mamaroneck, New York, where his parents, whose high expectations he constantly fails to meet, have become frustrated with his explosive temper and violent tendencies. He has gotten into trouble with school and the law, and resents all manifestations of authority. His criminal aptitude, however, enable the Bedwetters to steal a car and to force the bowlers, who hassle them in Flagstaff, to retreat to their car.
