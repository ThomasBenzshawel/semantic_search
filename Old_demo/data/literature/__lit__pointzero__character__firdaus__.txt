Firdaus is a woman struggling to live a dignified life in a society in
				which women have limited options. Throughout the book, Firdaus fights not just
				to be in control of her own destiny but also to figure out who she is. But she
				has little time to devote to self-exploration. The scene in Bayoumi’s coffee
				shop is an example of this. Bayoumi asks Firdaus whether she wants oranges or
				tangerines, and Firdaus is unable to answer him, having never considered whether
				she might like one thing more than another. For most of her life, it has never
				been important what she wanted. What was important was what the
				men around her wanted. And as Firdaus tells it, all of the men around her are
				brutes who exult in the power that they have over women. To some extent,
				Firdaus’s life becomes about living in opposition to the men in her life. Taking
				pleasure from a relationship with men is never really an option for her. This is
				partially because she needs to be treated like an equal, which never happens,
				but also because of her clitoridectomy. This procedure robs her of pleasure
				during sex.

By the time Firdaus becomes a prostitute, she has discovered that she can
				exploit the desire that many men have for her by getting money for it. She
				learns that people with money can also command respect. But having money and
				commanding respect do not make Firdaus feel respectable. To someone who dreamed
				of studying and becoming a scholar, the life of a prostitute is disappointing
				and demeaning, yet Firdaus also suggests that the life of a prostitute might be
				a surer path to dignity and self-determination than the “respectable” life of an
				office assistant. At least as a prostitute Firdaus need not show deference
				toward even the most powerful of men.
