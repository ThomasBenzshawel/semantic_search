In some ways, Frank’s father can be considered the antagonist
				of Angela’s Ashes, because his actions keep the
				McCourts destitute. (As antagonist is a character or obstacle in
				a literary work that opposes the protagonist and causes the major
				conflict.) While his family suffers from crippling hunger, and his
				children contract diseases caused by weakness and malnutrition,
				Malachy drinks excessively and comes home roaring that his sons
				must be ready to die for Ireland. 

Frank’s father drinks himself into a stupor partially
				to dull the pain of the deaths of his twin sons and baby daughter.
				But McCourt emphasizes that Malachy’s drinking is more than just
				a means of coping with bereavement; it is an illness that constantly
				jeopardizes the survival of his family. Despite the burdens that
				Malachy’s alcoholism places on Frank’s shoulders, Frank almost always
				remains loyal to his father. He treasures the times that he and
				Malachy sit chatting and drinking tea in front of the fire and loves
				his father’s way with words, his lively imagination, and his flair
				for storytelling. 

When Malachy goes to work in England, he uses his physical
				distance to justify abandoning his family, leaving them without
				his emotional or financial support.
