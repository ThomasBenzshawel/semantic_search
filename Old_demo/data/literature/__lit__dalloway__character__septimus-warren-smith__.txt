Septimus, a veteran of World War I, suffers from shell
				shock and is lost within his own mind. He feels guilty even as he
				despises himself for being made numb by the war. His doctor has
				ordered Lucrezia, Septimus’s wife, to make Septimus notice things
				outside himself, but Septimus has removed himself from the physical
				world. Instead, he lives in an internal world, wherein he sees and
				hears things that aren’t really there and he talks to his dead friend
				Evans. He is sometimes overcome with the beauty in the world, but
				he also fears that the people in it have no capacity for honesty
				or kindness. Woolf intended for Clarissa to speak the sane truth
				and Septimus the insane truth, and indeed Septimus’s detachment
				enables him to judge other people more harshly than Clarissa is
				capable of. The world outside of Septimus is threatening, and the
				way Septimus sees that world offers little hope. 

On the surface, Septimus seems quite dissimilar to Clarissa,
				but he embodies many characteristics that Clarissa shares and thinks
				in much the same way she does. He could almost be her double in
				the novel. Septimus and Clarissa both have beak-noses, love Shakespeare,
				and fear oppression. More important, as Clarissa’s double, Septimus
				offers a contrast between the conscious struggle of a working-class
				veteran and the blind opulence of the upper class. His troubles
				call into question the legitimacy of the English society he fought to
				preserve during the war. Because his thoughts often run parallel to
				Clarissa’s and echo hers in many ways, the thin line between what is
				considered sanity and insanity gets thinner and thinner. Septimus chooses
				to escape his problems by killing himself, a dramatic and tragic
				gesture that ultimately helps Clarissa to accept her own choices,
				as well as the society in which she lives.
