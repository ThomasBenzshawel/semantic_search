Though his role as Keeper of the Builders is an important one, antagonistic Gally boasts that he is the real leader of the Glade. With his disfigured nose, discolored and broken teeth, and rotten breath, Gally’s physical appearance reflects his inner darkness. Though his repellant personality may be a result of undergoing the Changing, the true reason matters little, as Gally’s presence causes discord from the novel’s opening. His constant accusations and threats of physical violence diminish the sense that he is a true threat, though his unpredictability does keep others on their toes. Gally’s hatred of Thomas is ultimately driven by an unwavering commitment to rules and safety, as well as a deep desire to uncover the truth of the Gladers’ circumstances.
