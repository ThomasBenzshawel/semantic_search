If the Metamorphoses can be said to have
				a protagonist, Jupiter, the king of heaven, is that protagonist.
				He is the first god on the scene in Book I as he encounters the
				impious Lycaon, and he is present at the end of the poem in the
				Book XV at the deification of Julius Caesar. Jupiter’s frequent
				presence in the poem does not, however, mean that he is a character
				worthy of respect. In most instances, Ovid portrays Jupiter as foolish,
				rash, and lustful. Jupiter destroys the world out of anger at one
				man, he rapes countless women (Io, Europa, Callisto, and Semele,
				to name a few), and he constantly deceives his wife, Juno, whom
				he fears. When Jupiter does attempt to do good deeds, he bungles
				them. When he tries to defend Dis, for example, he tells Ceres that
				at least her daughter, Proserpina, was raped by a god with good
				lineage. Ovid’s portrayal of Jupiter is sometimes comic and nearly
				always dark.
