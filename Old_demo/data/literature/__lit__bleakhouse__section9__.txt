The narrator says that Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up to his
					room at Chesney Wold, happy that he told the story. He steps outside
					and looks at the stars. Lady Dedlock appears. He tells her that
					he felt he had to let her know that he knew her secret, and that
					only he knows it so far. She tells him that he was right, and that
					she knows what will happen to Rosa if her secret is discovered.
					She offers to write down details to save Sir Leicester any trouble,
					but Tulkinghorn says it isn’t necessary. She tells him that her
					jewels and other valuables are all in their places. Tulkinghorn
					doesn’t understand what she means, and Lady Dedlock declares that
					she is leaving Chesney Wold immediately. He doesn’t try to stop
					her but wants to tell her something first. She tells him she wants
					to move toward the window, and Tulkinghorn fears she’ll jump out
					and kill herself. But she doesn’t. He tells her that his only concern
					in all this is Sir Leicester and that her disappearance will destroy
					him and make her secret immediately known to all. Tulkinghorn suggests
					that she stay and continue to hide her guilt. He says he will alert
					her when he must make the secret known. She leaves his room.

The narrator says that Tulkinghorn goes to Lincoln’s Inn
					Fields in London. Snagsby arrives at his office with some information
					about Mademoiselle Hortense. He says his wife is very jealous because Mademoiselle
					Hortense has been hovering around his shop, determined that someone
					should let her in to see Tulkinghorn. Tulkinghorn says to send her
					to him.

He goes to his chambers. The narrator says it is too dark
					to see the painted Roman on the ceiling, who points downward. Tulkinghorn
					unlocks a series of small chests and retrieves a key. He intends to
					go to the wine cellar, but there is a knock at his door. It is Mademoiselle
					Hortense. She angrily says that she has done what Tulkinghorn wanted—she
					showed him her dress that Lady Dedlock wore, she has met “that boy”—and
					Tulkinghorn says that he paid her. She says she hasn’t spent the
					money because she is so angry, and she throws it into a corner.
					She says that she hates Lady Dedlock and asks Tulkinghorn to find
					her a new job. If he can’t, she offers to help Tulkinghorn disgrace
					Lady Dedlock. She says she will keep coming to him until he gives
					her what she wants. Tulkinghorn refuses. He says that if she harasses
					him, she will go to prison. She leaves, enraged.

Esther studiously avoids mentioning Lady Dedlock, and
					she does her best not to think about her. She says it doesn’t matter
					how she struggled not to think about her voice or how she obsessively
					looked for Lady Dedlock’s name in public.

Esther and Ada talk with Mr. Jarndyce about Richard. Mr. Jarndyce
					no longer seems to hope that Richard will give up the Jarndyce and
					Jarndyce lawsuit. Esther reveals that Skimpole has been encouraging
					Richard, but Mr. Jarndyce can’t be angry because Skimpole is such
					a child. Esther also tells him that Skimpole introduced Richard
					to Vholes for five pounds, but Mr. Jarndyce is convinced Skimpole
					didn’t mean any harm. They go to London to visit Skimpole, who lives
					in a dingy apartment. He is happy to see them and seems characteristically
					childlike, which seems to be a relief to Mr. Jarndyce. He tells
					Skimpole that he mustn’t take money from Richard, but Skimpole says
					he can’t refuse. He says he thought Richard was rich. He also says
					he is unable to stop encouraging Richard in the lawsuit, since he
					understands nothing about it. Skimpole introduces them to his three
					daughters and his wife and prepares to go to Bleak House with the
					group.

Esther observes that she didn’t anticipate at this point
					that something very remarkable was going to happen by the end of
					the day.

Sir Leicester visits Bleak House unexpectedly. He tells
					Mr. Jarndyce, Esther, and Ada that he hopes that they are not under
					the impression that, because of his feud with Boythorn, they aren’t
					welcome at Chesney Wold. He says that Mrs. Rouncewell told him that a
					friend of theirs named Skimpole was prevented from seeing the family
					art. Mr. Jarndyce introduces him to Skimpole, who is in the room.
					Skimpole says he will visit again. Sir Leicester says he regrets if
					there was any confusion about their welcome at Chesney Wold, especially
					since Lady Dedlock respects Mr. Jarndyce.

Esther decides to tell Mr. Jarndyce her secret. She asks
					if he remembers Lady Dedlock speaking of her sister, and that the
					two women had parted ways. She asks why they separated, but Mr. Jarndyce
					claims not to know. But he asks if Esther knows that Boythorn’s
					old lover was Lady Dedlock’s sister. Esther responds that she hadn’t
					known this. Mr. Jarndyce tells her that this sister and Boythorn
					separated because of a quarrel she had with Lady Dedlock. She wrote
					Boythorn a letter saying she was dead to him, and he never saw her
					again.

Esther is overcome with grief because she believes that
					she has caused Boythorn’s heartbreak. She tells Mr. Jarndyce that
					the sister was her caretaker, and Lady Dedlock is her mother. Mr.
					Jarndyce comforts her and Esther is deeply grateful to him for his
					kindness, feeling that she can never repay him.

Mr. Jarndyce tells Esther that she must keep her secret
					and not tell anyone. Esther says that besides Tulkinghorn, she worries
					that Mr. Guppy and Mademoiselle Hortense may have suspicions. Before Esther
					leaves his room, Mr. Jarndyce says he has something to say to her,
					but that he would rather write it down in a letter. He also says that
					no matter what happens, he will never be changed from as he is right
					now.

On the agreed-upon day, Esther sends Charley to get the
					letter. Esther isn’t surprised that it’s a marriage proposal. She
					believes that this is a way for her to thank him and make him happy,
					and the letter makes her happy, but still she cries, feeling as
					though she has lost something. She tells herself that she must be
					cheerful from here on out, because she will be happy for the rest
					of her life. She then remembers Mr. Woodcourt’s flowers, which she
					burns in the candle.

A few days later, she tells Mr. Jarndyce she has decided
					to accept the proposal.

When Esther and Ada are walking in the garden, Esther
					sees Mr. Vholes and Richard enter Bleak House. Charley retrieves
					Esther and tells her to go to Mr. Jarndyce, who introduces her to
					Vholes. Vholes explains that Richard’s finances are a mess, and
					that Vholes can make no more advances. He hopes Richard won’t have
					to leave his commission. Vholes wanted to alert Mr. Jarndyce to
					Richard’s state of affairs.

Mr. Jarndyce asks Esther to try to help Richard, and she
					agrees to go to Deal, where Richard is stationed. Charley accompanies
					her, and Ada gives Esther a letter for Richard. Esther visits Richard
					without warning. He looks unhealthy and tired and admits that he’s
					having problems. He says he has left his commission, since he’s
					too much trouble to the authorities. He cares only for the Jarndyce
					and Jarndyce lawsuit now and won’t let Esther protest. He reads
					Ada’s letter, in which she offers him a small inheritance. Richard
					is overcome with despair. He then becomes angry, certain that Mr. Jarndyce
					had ulterior motives for trying to separate him from Ada. He says
					he won’t accept Ada’s offer but trusts Vholes to keep moving forward
					with the suit. He listens to Esther’s pleas, but they do no good.

On her way back to the hotel, Esther sees a boat landing
					on the beach with many excited people gathered around it. Esther
					recognizes Mr. Woodcourt and rushes away. At the hotel, Esther chastises herself
					and writes a note letting him know that she is there. When Mr. Woodcourt
					visits her, Esther believes she can see how sorry he is for her
					because of her scarred face. Richard arrives, and he and Mr. Woodcourt
					converse. Later, Esther asks Mr. Woodcourt if he will befriend Richard
					and visit him frequently in London. She says she, Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce
					will be very grateful. Mr. Woodcourt agrees.

Women wield a great deal of power in Bleak House, and
					one of the only instances of weakness occurs when Tulkinghorn convinces Lady
					Dedlock to stay at Chesney Wold in order to protect her secret. Excepting
					her emotional discovery of and reunion with her daughter, Lady Dedlock
					has always put on a haughty, implacable front. Society looks up
					to her, and she is the emblem of what a great lady is supposed to
					be. When Tulkinghorn makes it clear that he has the power to destroy
					her at any time, Lady Dedlock finds herself at someone else’s mercy
					for the first time. Tulkinghorn recognizes the shock this must be;
					indeed, when Lady Dedlock requests that they speak by the window,
					he worries that she plans to kill herself. Shortly after this scene,
					Mademoiselle Hortense attempts to wield her own power over Tulkinghorn.
					She, of a much lesser station than Lady Dedlock, isn’t so easily
					thwarted, and when Tulkinghorn threatens her, she threatens him
					right back. The fact that Lady Dedlock does give in to Tulkinghorn
					reveals the depths to which she has fallen, making the extent of
					her desperation clear.

Esther is the unwitting cause of many people’s unhappiness, which
					is ironic considering her selfless, generous nature. She is at the heart
					of Lady Dedlock’s secret, the source of much of her guilt, shame,
					and regret. She could easily bring about Lady Dedlock’s downfall,
					as well as Sir Leicester’s and the entire Dedlock clan. Because
					of Esther’s birth, the relationship between Lady Dedlock and her
					sister, Miss Barbary, was destroyed, as was the relationship between
					Miss Barbary and Mr. Boythorn. Esther, who wants nothing but happiness
					for those she loves, has indirectly brought about desperation and
					heartbreak. When she tells her secret to Mr. Jarndyce, she seems
					to half expect him to shun her for the havoc she passively wrought.

Although Mr. Jarndyce’s marriage proposal is rooted in
					love, it isn’t rooted in romantic love, a distinction that Esther
					feels intuitively but can’t quite articulate. The letter is full
					of affection and admiration, and the picture of her future life
					that Mr. Jarndyce paints for her is happy and peaceful, but Esther
					senses that something will still be missing. She tells herself she
					is happy with the proposal, but she does so while sobbing. Burning
					Mr. Woodcourt’s flowers seems to be her acknowledgment that her
					hope for romantic love, however small, must now be forgotten forever.
					Indeed, since Mr. Jarndyce has always been such a father figure
					for Esther that his marriage proposal instantly seems troubling,
					even inappropriate, and their relationship lurches into complicated
					new territory. She still calls him “guardian,” and she says her
					acceptance “made no difference.” She kisses him, but it seems devoid
					of passion, and as Esther’s narrative continues, things seem very
					much as they have always been. She may be the intended mistress
					of Bleak House, but at this point her position seems not to have
					changed at all.
