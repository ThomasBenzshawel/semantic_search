					The Schlegels take Aunt Juley, a German cousin,
					and their cousin's suitor to a performance of
					Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  There, Margaret meets
					and converses with a lower-class young man named
					Leonard Bast.  Tibby watches the music with a
					score on his knee, and Aunt Juley taps her foot.
					During the last two movements of the symphony,
					Helen imagines goblins dancing over the universe,
					implying that no valor or heroism exists in the
					world.  Moved, she runs from the room, accidentally
					taking Leonard's umbrella.  After the concert,
					Leonard accompanies Margaret back to the
					Schlegel house on Wickham Place to retrieve his
					umbrella.  At Wickham Place, Helen inadvertently
					insults the umbrella, causing Leonard to hurry
					away in shame.  The Schlegels continue talking about art
					and literature, but they are slightly unsettled by
					their encounter.
				


					For his part, Leonard is poor, but not
					desperately so: He has just enough education and
					sufficient possessions to assert that he is not
					inferior to the rich.  Walking away from the
					Schlegels,' he passes a fellow clerk on the street
					and nods to him.  He enters his dim basement
					apartment, accidentally breaks a picture frame
					surrounding a photograph of a smiling woman, and
					begins reading Ruskin's Stones of Venice in
					the hopes of learning to understand English prose.
					He thinks that if only he could acquire the kind of
					culture the Schlegel sisters possess, he would be in a
					different boat altogether.  His lover Jacky, the
					smiling woman from the photograph, enters;
					thirty-three years old, she is plump, garish, and vulgar,
					and loudly demands to know when he intends to marry
					her.  He repeats his promise to marry her on his
					21st birthday.  After a meager dinner, Jacky
					goes to bed, and Leonard ignores the sound of her
					voice calling him and continues to peruse the Ruskin
					book.
				


					The day after the concert, Aunt Juley presents
					Margaret with what she thinks is terrible news: The
					Wilcoxes have taken a flat in a building on Wickham
					Place, opposite the Schlegels.'  Margaret is unperturbed,
					saying that Helen's feelings for Paul are long since
					dead; Aunt Juley insists that the Wilcoxes' presence
					is a catastrophe.  When Helen enters and learns what has
					happened, she blushes furiously, lending credence to Aunt
					Juley's theory.  Luckily, Helen is planning a trip with
					their German cousin Frieda, and will be away until
					after the New Year.
				


					Shortly after the Wilcoxes move into their new flat,
					Mrs. Wilcox calls on Margaret.  Margaret, who is
					not home when Mrs. Wilcox appears, does not return
					the call, writing a note to Mrs. Wilcox suggesting
					that, given the difficult situation Helen and Paul
					placed them in, it would be best if they did not
					meet.  Mrs. Wilcox writes a note back saying that
					Margaret has been rude--she only wanted to tell
					Margaret that Paul has left for Nigeria.  Feeling
					horribly guilty, Margaret rushes to the Wilcoxes,'
					where she apologizes profusely for having offended
					Mrs. Wilcox.  Frail and spending the day in bed, Mrs.
					Wilcox asks Margaret to keep her company; Margaret
					does so, and the two women gradually become friends.
					Margaret learns that Howards End actually belongs to
					Mrs. Wilcox, not her husband. She was born there and
					has lived there her whole life.  Margaret gives a
					luncheon for Mrs. Wilcox, but it is a complete
					failure.  Margaret's friends only talk about art,
					culture, and politics, leaving Mrs. Wilcox, who has
					spent her life caring for a husband and children,
					with nothing to say.  Nevertheless, they all feel
					that in some indescribable way Mrs. Wilcox is greater
					than they are, as though she transcends their
					conversation.  After the luncheon, Margaret
					apologizes to Mrs. Wilcox again; Mrs. Wilcox insists
					that she had a wonderful time, and the two women
					clasp hands with genuine feeling.
				


					The introduction of Leonard brings a third
					symbolic type into the novel to contrast with the
					wealthy and idealistic Schlegels and the wealthy and
					pragmatic Wilcoxes.  Leonard Bast does not exactly
					represent the poor (Forster says that the actual poor
					are in an "abyss," and are unimaginable to anyone who
					is not poor), but rather the very bottom rung of the
					lower-middle class.  He has an office job, a
					furnished apartment, and the rudiments of an
					education, but still he is light-years away from the
					lifestyle enjoyed by the Schlegels, as his visit to
					Wickham Place makes clear to him.  His poverty makes
					him suspicious and mean-spirited, and his home life,
					with his bawdy, aging lover, Jacky, looming over his
					shoulder, is made worse by the terrible contrast
					between his surroundings and the book he is reading.
					Leonard believes that if he attends classical music
					concerts and reads Ruskin (a famous 19th century
					essayist and art critic), he will be able to better
					himself.  But the cultured, pampered voice in the book
					is utterly irrelevant to his daily life as a
					low-level clerk for an insurance company.
				


					Margaret's surprising friendship with Mrs.
					Wilcox is Forster's second attempt to bring the two
					main families of the novel--and the two symbolic
					ideas they represent--into a union.  Mrs. Wilcox is a
					very different creature from her husband and
					children, replacing their materialistic
					hard-headedness with a kind of selfless, loving
					sensitivity to those around her.  It is also a
					surprise for the reader to learn that Howards End
					actually belongs to Mrs. Wilcox (we will learn that
					her maiden name is Howard, and it was a family farm
					for generations).  In this sense, as the novel
					progresses, Mrs. Wilcox emerges as a metaphor for
					England's past, and Howards End becomes a metaphor
					for England itself.
