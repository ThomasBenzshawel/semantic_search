In Our Time is a collection of short stories by American writer Ernest Hemingway that was first published in 1925. Republished with varying contents several times, it contains short stories and thematically-linked vignettes interspersed between them that are numbered, but not always sequentially. In Our Time, which introduced Hemingway as a promising fiction writer, contains several of his early classics such as the Nick Adams stories “Indian Camp” and “The Three Day Blow.” Hemingway’s use of spare, precise language results in a sense of moral value and clear vision being delivered through the simplest of statements.
