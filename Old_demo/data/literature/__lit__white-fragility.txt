White Fragility is a nonfiction work by sociologist Robin DiAngelo that was first published in 2018. In it, DiAngelo explores a phenomenon she calls “white fragility” and defines as a white person’s inability to talk about or reflect on structural racism and their role within the system without feeling attacked or becoming defensive. By identifying its roots and current manifestation within society, DiAngelo seeks to dismantle white fragility through constructive reflection and contextual understanding. White Fragility debuted at the top of the sales charts and remained on the New York Times Bestseller List for more than a year.
