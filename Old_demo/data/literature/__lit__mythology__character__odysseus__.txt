Odysseus, king of Ithaca, is one of the best-known ancient
				Greek heroes. Homer’s Iliad and Virgil’s Aeneid both
				portray Odysseus as, if not the strongest Greek chieftain in the
				Trojan War, certainly the smartest and likely the most valuable.
				He is entrusted with any task that requires more than brute force,
				from drawing the great Achilles into the Greek army to inventing
				the tactic of the Trojan Horse—the ruse that finally enabled the
				Greeks to win the war. Odysseus’s sharp wit works wonders that no
				feat of arms can achieve. It is in reflection of this worth that
				Odysseus is given the fallen Achilles’ armor, the highest honor
				for a warrior.

Homer’s other epic, the Odyssey, records
				Odysseus’s journey back to Ithaca from Troy. It is the first—and
				until the Aeneid, the only—large-scale classical
				work focusing on one character. As such, Homer gives Odysseus a
				depth of character and richness of psychological texture lacking
				in other classical protagonists. Without supernatural powers or
				divine heritage, Odysseus must rely on his own shrewd intellect
				to survive—a human and modern approach to the challenges and temptations
				he encounters.
