Born at the stroke of midnight and named after the Hindu
				god of destruction, Shiva is Saleem’s rival and counterpart. Switched
				at birth with Saleem, Shiva is robbed of his affluent birthright
				and raised in abject poverty. Blessed with a pair of enormous and
				powerful knees, Shiva is a gifted warrior and, therefore, a foil
				for the more mild-mannered Saleem. Shiva represents the alternate
				side of India: poor, Hindu, and as aggressive as Saleem is passive.
				As a young child, he is the leader of a street gang and possibly
				a murderer. He is driven by a determinedly individualist perspective
				and grows up unable to form any human attachments. Although he is
				a violent character, he is, nonetheless, a tragic figure, damaged
				and shaped by the forces of history and class. During the 1971 war
				between India and Pakistan, Shiva lives up to his name and becomes
				a war hero, eventually promoted to the rank of major. Along with
				his military reputation, Shiva also becomes a noted lover among
				the women of Indian high society, siring a number of illegitimate
				children. In the end, Shiva hunts Saleem down and turns him over
				to one the camps opened during Indira Gandhi’s state of Emergency,
				where Saleem, along with the other midnight’s children, is administered
				an operation that renders him sterile. In this way, Shiva manages
				to effectively destroy the children of midnight.
