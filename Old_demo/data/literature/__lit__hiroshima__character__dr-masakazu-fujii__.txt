A successful physician, Dr. Fujii owns a small, private
				medical clinic and has a wife who lives in Osaka. When the bomb
				strikes, his entire clinic topples into the water. Dr. Fujii rebuilds
				his Hiroshima clinic in 1948 and has a successful
				career mainly treating and socializing with members of the American
				occupation. He drinks, plays golf, and studies languages.

	Dr. Fujiiâ€™s life changes very little as a result of the
				bombing. His injuries heal and he is able to continue his profession
				comfortably and lucratively. Of all the characters, however, his
				life ends under the worst circumstances. He dies after being in
				a coma for eleven years, with his family in discord. Hersey notes
				that his wife and son squabble over his inheritance after his death,
				leading to a lawsuit.
