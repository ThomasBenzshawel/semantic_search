A Medieval Life is a speculative biography by medieval scholar, teacher, and writer Judith Bennett that was first published in 1998. With the subtitle Cecilia Penifader of Bridgestock c. 1295–1344, Bennett’s book uses historical facts to piece together a vivid description of the life of Cecilia Penifader, a 14th century woman peasant woman who lived on a feudal manor in the English countryside. Organized topically rather than chronologically, A Medieval Life focuses on rural peasant life under feudalism during the late medieval period with an emphasis on women’s history.
