Homecoming, a young adult novel by Cynthia Voigt, was first published in 1981. It is the first book in the seven-part Tillerman Cycle and tells the story of four siblings—Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy—who are abandoned by their mother in a mall parking lot and must find their way to their great-aunt’s house in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The novel explores themes of family, resilience, and identity as the children confront the challenges of their journey and the realities of their past.
