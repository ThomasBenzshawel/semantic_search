Proud, stubborn, selfish, and competitive, Larry Cook gained success and respect because of his calculated farming skills and his willingness to take advantage of other people’s hard times. After the transfer of the farm to his daughters, Larry becomes irrational and erratic. By the time of the hearing in court, he is completely unhinged, mumbling nonsense and repeating falsehoods. Readers learn little about the kind of man Larry was when he married Ann. They learn a lot about the kind of man he was after his wife’s death, mostly through the memories of his two oldest daughters. Ginny calls him “fearsome” and a “monolith.” Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the novel’s ending is Larry’s quiet death. He is never forced to confront his past, never forced to feel remorse, and never publicly scorned for the sexual abuse he inflicted upon his daughters. He gets away with his crimes and holds on to his good name, at least in public. Larry changes because of his mental decline, but he never changes in character.
