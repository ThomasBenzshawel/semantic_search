Leaving Selden's apartment, Lily goes to rest in Bryant
Park. She knows that there is nothing for her at home except a bed
and her bottle of sleeping medicine. As night comes on, a passerby
asks if she is sick before recognizing her. The passerby is Nettie
Struther, a character we have not yet met but who met Lily when
Lily saved her from an illness while participating in Gerty's charity
organization. Although Nettie was sick, she has totally recovered,
and is enjoying a successful marriage with her husband and their
newborn child. Nettie, seeing that Lily is sick, takes her home
to her house, where Lily warms up in the kitchen while Nettie tells
Lily of her success in working her way up from the gutter to a happy
family life. After briefly holding Nettie's baby, Lily says she
must leave, but promises to return another day. The encounter has
made her happier and stronger, although only briefly.

At home, Lily begins to furiously sort out her various
possessions for no apparent reason; she is interrupted by when a
servant delivers a letter to her containing her check from Mrs.
Peniston's estate. Shocked, Lily begins writing checks to pay off
all her debts to Gus Trenor and other outstanding loans. She realizes
that even though she is now free of all debt, she has absolutely
no money, and all she can look forward to in life is a prevailing
dinginess enshrouding middle age. Extraordinarily tired from lack
of sleep, Lily takes out her sleeping medicine to help her doze
off. In the medicine, she sees a long escape from the dreariness
of her life, and decides to take much more than the prescribed amount
in hopes of sleeping for a long time. In doing so, she overdoses
on the medication and dies in her sleep. Whether or not she knew
she was committing suicide is left ambiguous and unresolved by the
novel.

The next day is marked by beautiful weather, as Selden
sets out from the Benedick to visit Lily. Realizing his love for
her and her desperation, he has decided to propose marriage to her.
When he arrives at her apartment, however, he is greeted by a distraught Gerty
Farish, who has found Lily's dead body. Gerty leaves him to take
care of Lily's papers and belongings, but before Selden can leave,
he feels tempted to lie down next to Lily and rest his head on her
shoulder, which he could never do while she still lived. Getting up,
he goes through her check book, and finds that she received the estate
check and paid off all her debts, including the one to Trenor. He
cannot decide, though, if the check to Trenor explains the mystery
of her demise or only deepens it. The novel ends with Selden and Lily,
alone together at last, as he realizes how much he loved her and how
his own cowardice had kept them apart at the crucial moment when
they could have been married.

One may ask why Wharton chooses to introduce a new character, Nettie,
so late in the novel. For one thing, Nettie contributes to the ironic
structure of the novel's narrative. Obviously, Lily has gone from
a position in which she could offer help to one in which she needs
help from one who she had earlier saved. Perhaps more importantly,
though, Nettie provides a symbolic foil, or counterpart, to Lily.
Nettie represents the things that Lily could have been (and perhaps
even still could be). We learn that like Lily, Nettie suffered from
dire mental problems, but after healing herself and returning to
society, she had success in finding a husband and starting a family.
Because Lily could feasibly meet with the same success as Nettie,
we have to frown upon Lily's death as a waste. Even though Lily
feels hopeless, Nettie proves that no situation is so entirely hopeless
as to warrant death.

The actual ending of The House of Mirth is
one of the most ambiguous endings in all of literature. Perhaps
the most fundamental question is whether or not Lily commits suicide.
On the one hand, she desperately wants to sleep for a long time.
She sees no way out of her current situation and can only imagine
for herself a long life of the dinginess she has always hated. On
the other hand, Lily has made promises to get together again with
Nettie, and she has asked Rosedale to visit her often. She also
tells Selden that she will see him again, but not for a long time,
as though she were going to take a long vacation by herself. Furthermore,
with the reception of the estate check, Lily is no longer in debt;
she is free of any slavery impulses.

Given that there is no right or wrong answer that explains
Lily's death, we must interpret its meaning. Overall, Lily's death
completes the downward spiral which the whole novel has chronicled. Death
is, as we saw earlier in the book, the final state of rest for anyone;
it is the absolute lowest rung on the social ladder, which Lily has
been descending throughout Book Two. Structurally, then, one can
argue that Lily's death makes sense and is necessary. However, thematically,
Wharton seems to condemn Lily's death by introducing Nettie. If
a character like Nettie can rise up out of total despair, we have
to assume that Lily could as well. Furthermore, Lily's death seems
so unnecessary in light of the fact that so many people are willing
to help her in every way possible. No one should die like Lily does
if he or she has a good group of caring friends.
