Cilla is the granddaughter of Johnny’s master, the silversmith Ephraim
				Lapham. At the book’s start, fourteen-year-old Cilla is promised
				to Johnny in marriage because of an economic arrangement to keep
				the silver shop in the Lapham family. Following Johnny’s disfigurement,
				however, this arrangement is cancelled. Like Rab, Cilla seems to
				be Johnny’s opposite in many ways. Though she is very bright, she
				is too self-effacing to demand to be taught how to read and write.
				Instead, she devotes her energy to her sickly, but beautiful, younger
				sister, Isannah, using any extra money she can find to buy the spoiled
				child ribbons and other treats. Sensitive and thoughtful, Cilla
				secretly sneaks food into the impoverished Johnny’s pockets in the
				interim period between his accident and his new home with Rab. When
				wealthy Lavinia Lyte becomes enchanted with Isannah, Cilla follows
				her sister to the Lyte home because she wants to accompany Isannah.
				Cilla works at the Lyte home as a lower-class servant, while Lavinia
				parades Isannah around Boston high society. As Lavinia cleverly
				tears Isannah away from Cilla, Cilla suffers silently and stoically.

	On the other hand, Cilla has a caustic wit,
				teasing Johnny mercilessly and trading jabs with Rab. Cilla is self-reliant,
				a hard worker, and a kind person. Over the course of the book, Cilla develops
				from a skinny child into a beautiful young woman, and she begins
				to attract attention from men for the first time. Rab takes an interest
				in her, as does a young British soldier named Pumpkin, but it is
				Johnny that she has cared for all along. Like many colonists, she
				becomes an ardent Whig, and she refuses to leave for London with
				the rest of the Lyte household, including Isannah, on the eve of
				the Revolution. At the book’s end, Cilla loses her sister but gains
				the boy she has always loved.
