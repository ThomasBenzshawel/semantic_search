Christiana is introduced in Part I of the book as Christian’s
				wife. She and Christian are each other’s better halves, as shown
				by their names. Yet Christiana does not agree to accompany her husband
				on his journey to the Celestial City in Part I. She seems beholden
				to the worldly values and limitations from which Christian must
				break free. But, at the beginning of Part II, she develops a deep
				appreciation of the value of pilgrimage. Indeed, her resolution
				to embark on a pilgrimage carries even more weight in some ways
				than Christian’s decision did, since she has more responsibilities.
				She has four children to care for during a perilous and exhausting
				journey. As a woman, she risks dangers that a male traveler escapes.
				And her final success as a pilgrim may even outstrip Christian’s,
				since she and her group achieve victories unknown to him, like slaying
				Giant Despair. In the end, Christiana emerges as a hero at least
				on par with her famous husband.

Christiana demonstrates an attunement to more worldly
				matters, grasping more about the everyday workings of the social
				world than her husband cared to know. For example, she deals with
				sick children and babysitters. She asks Mercy to accompany her as
				her servant. Christian never had an employee. When she leaves the House
				Beautiful, she gives the porter Watchful a tip of a golden angel
				coin, a considerable sum. In contrast, Christian never tips anyone
				because he believes money is evil. Christiana shows a more worldly
				awareness that money can be used for good as well as bad. She understands
				that certain worldly things like gold and employment can be integrated
				into a truly spiritual existence. The way her worldliness balances
				her faith gives Christiana a fullness that Christian lacks.
