A fight breaks out as Hawkeye and the Mohicans attack
					the Hurons, whose rifles have been set aside. In the battle, Uncas
					saves Cora and Chingachgook becomes locked in hand-to-hand combat with
					Magua, who escapes only by feigning his own death. Hawkeye and the
					Mohicans soundly defeat the remaining Hurons and free the prisoners.
					Chingachgook scalps the dead victims, while Heyward and Uncas ensure
					the well-being of Cora and Alice. After Hawkeye releases Gamut,
					they argue about the efficacy of prayer-song. Hawkeye cites the
					pragmatic necessities of battle to urge the psalmodist to abandon
					the useless weapon of the pitch pipe. Resisting Hawkeye’s logic,
					Gamut responds by citing the religious doctrine of predetermination
					and singing another song. Ignoring the performance, Hawkeye reloads
					his rifle, and the group begins to travel northward toward Fort
					William Henry. Hawkeye explains that with the brilliant aid of Uncas
					he and Chingachgook succeeded in tracking the Hurons for twenty
					miles.

The party travels to a ruined blockhouse where Chingachgook
					and Hawkeye won a battle many years before. The memorial site spurs Hawkeye
					to describe the Mohicans as the last of their tribe. The group,
					with the exception of Chingachgook, sleeps until nightfall, when
					sounds of nearby enemies cause alarm. The sounds they hear are made
					by the Hurons, who have lost their way. Two Indians approach, but
					their respect for the memorial site keeps them away. After the Hurons
					depart, the group continues toward the fort.

The group treads barefoot through a stream in order to
					hide its tracks. They pass a pond, and Hawkeye tells
					the group it is filled with corpses of slain French soldiers. As
					they near the besieged Fort William Henry, they encounter a French
					sentinel. Heyward talks to him in French, distracting him while
					Chingachgook sneaks up to the sentinel, kills him, and scalps him.
					Firing breaks out between English troops protecting the fort and
					French forces, and the crossfire puts the party in danger. Thick
					fog conceals them, however, and they attempt to find their way to
					the fort through the sounds of battle. The French forces pursue
					them, but they arrive at the fort safely. As they enter the fort,
					Colonel Munro weeps and embraces his daughters.

Five days into the siege of Fort William Henry, Heyward
					discovers that the French have captured Hawkeye. Inside the fort,
					Heyward sees Alice, who teases him for not seeing her and her sister
					enough, and Cora, who seems distressed. Though the French forces
					eventually release Hawkeye, the French leader Montcalm keeps the
					letter that Hawkeye carried from General Webb. Montcalm requests
					a meeting with Munro, but Munro sends Heyward in his place. The French
					general urges Major Heyward to surrender, reminding him that France’s
					bloodthirsty Indian allies are difficult to hold in check.

Heyward goes to find Munro, planning to report Montcalm’s
					message that the English should surrender. He finds Munro idling
					with his daughters. To Heyward’s surprise, Munro seems uninterested
					in Montcalm’s proposal. He accuses Heyward of racism for preferring Alice
					to Cora. Munro reveals that Cora and Alice have different mothers.
					Cora’s mother, Munro’s first wife, was from the West Indies and
					was part “Negro.” When Munro’s first wife died, he returned to Scotland
					and married his childhood sweetheart. Heyward heartily denies that
					he thinks less of Cora because of her mixed race, but silently he
					admits his racism. Munro and Heyward return to the French encampment
					to meet with Montcalm, who hands over Webb’s letter advising Munro
					to surrender the fort to the French. Montcalm tells Munro that if
					the English surrender, they will get to keep their arms, baggage,
					and colors, and the French will ensure that the Indians do not attack
					them. Munro accepts the offer and leaves Heyward to finalize the
					details.

After dawn, the English slowly file out of the fort, surrounded
					by columns of solemn French soldiers and leering Indians. One of
					the Indians tries to take a shawl from an Englishwoman as she passes by.
					When she pulls the shawl away from him, he seizes her baby and smashes
					it against the rocks. Then he sinks his tomahawk into the mother’s
					skull. Magua begins yelling the frenzied Indian war whoop, and the
					Indians attack the English, slaughtering them and drinking their
					blood. Munro storms through the battle to find Montcalm,
					ignoring even Alice’s cries for help. Magua sees Alice fainting
					and hurries away with her. Cora chases after him, followed by Gamut,
					who has been singing throughout the battle in order to confuse the
					Indians and keep them away from the young women. As the battle abates,
					the Indians begin looting the bodies of their victims.

Cooper suggests that the landscape poses real danger.
					The characters have extreme difficulty traveling safely through
					the frontier wilderness. Still, the group manages to meet the challenges
					of nature by exploiting nature itself—they take cover under fog,
					for example, and walk barefoot through the stream to hide their
					tracks. The ability of the group to thwart the challenges of nature
					subtly critiques Gamut’s Calvinist doctrines, which include the
					belief that man’s destiny is predetermined and human action cannot
					alter it. The group undermines this theory by forging its own destiny
					and manufacturing improbable survivals. Calvinism is a strict form
					of Protestantism derived from the teachings of French theologian
					John Calvin, and it soared in popularity during the first half of
					the nineteenth century. Both the masses and the literary elite followed
					Calvinist teachings. Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville, influential writers
					of the American generation following Cooper’s, embraced its fatalistic
					doctrines. 

	When the party encounters the French army surrounding
					the gates of Fort William Henry, the novel shifts its focus back
					to the history of the French and Indian War. The siege of Fort William
					Henry actually took place, and Cooper uses historical events such
					as this siege to give credence to his fictional plot and its messages
					about race relations. 

Cooper implies that Cora’s own mixed race explains her
					desire for an interracial relationship. Although Cooper opposes
					racism, he makes the racist suggestion that it is more natural for
					Cora to desire Uncas because of her own race, whereas it would not
					be as natural for the white Alice to desire Uncas. For the most
					part, however, Cooper stresses that Cora’s race ennobles her. She
					straddles the divide between white and Indian culture and is far
					stronger and more interesting than her sister. 

Characters respond differently to the specter of interracial
					love. Hawkeye, Cooper’s ideal heroic figure of the frontier, fervently opposes
					racial mixing despite his own easy friendship with Indians. Munro
					realizes that society condemns his marriage to a black woman, and
					while he acts ashamed of his first wife by stressing the great distance
					of her enslaved ancestors, he also angrily defends his wife and
					his daughter. Munro accuses Heyward of racism, a charge that troubles
					the latter. Although he denies his racism, Munro’s charge makes
					Heyward examine himself, and he realizes that his racism goes as
					deep “as if it had been ingrafted in his nature.”
