Shukhov, the title prisoner of the novel, is a poor and
				uneducated man. As such, he is an unusual protagonist in Russian
				literature. He is not an aristocrat, like most of the heroes of
				nineteenth-century Russian novels. He is also not a brilliant intellectual
				or impassioned sufferer, like some of nineteenth-century Russian
				novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky’s characters. As a peasant, Shukhov comes
				from a class not often featured in Russian novels. He may even be
				illiterate. When he sees the poem Kolya is copying out, for example,
				he does not recognize the strange way of writing each line directly
				beneath the preceding one. He is amazed by men such as Tsezar who
				have lived in Moscow, which to Shukhov is an exotic, faraway land.
				Nor is he a gifted or sensitive emotional soul: he shows almost
				no affection for his long-forgotten wife and daughters, no romantic
				nostalgia for his lost home, and no dreams of a better life elsewhere. Shukhov
				is an ordinary Russian, as implied by his name. “Ivan” is one of
				the most common names in the Russian language, like the English
				“John.” Solzhenitsyn makes this undistinguished man the hero of
				his novel in order to represent the uneducated peasant mainstream
				of Soviet society.

Shukhov’s struggle shows us the peasant’s inner nobility
				in the face of degradation. His full acceptance of his new identity
				and of his camp life, and his amazing ability to build a meaningful
				existence for himself out of the arbitrary camp system, make him
				a spiritual hero. His intensity in living, eating, and working puts
				him in control of his world. For example, when Shukhov works on
				a brick wall, the narrator says that he focuses on it as if he owned
				every inch of it. In a way, although he is a slave, he is still
				the king of his little area of the world. He is not an aristocrat
				by blood, but inwardly he is proud, supreme, and untouchable.
