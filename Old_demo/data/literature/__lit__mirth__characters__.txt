Lily, the novel's protagonist, is an unmarried 29-nine-year-old
woman who desires to be a social success. Her mission is to marry
a relatively wealthy man, thereby ensuring her financial stability
and a place in the higher levels of New York society. Unfortunately,
though, her desire to marry someone wealthy clashes with her feelings
for Lawrence Selden, a man of modest means whom she truly loves.
She also suffers from an inability to make decisions, which causes
her to pass up several good marriage opportunities in hopes that
she can do better. Book Two chronicles Lily's gradual expulsion from
society after a false rumor spreads that she has had an extramarital
affair. She eventually joins the working classes before dying at
the end of the novel from a sleeping medicine overdose.

Selden is a detached observer of the New York society
that Lily aspires to join. He is a lawyer by profession, but he
is not particularly wealthy, which prevents Lily from marrying him
even though they love one another. Throughout the novel, Selden
struggles between his desire to remain detached from society and his
wish to court Lily and convince her to marry him. At the end of
the novel, he resolves finally to propose marriage to Lily, but
his decision comes too lateâ€”he finds her dead in her apartment.

The wife of George Dorset. Most of the characters (including
perhaps her husband) know that she has a history of extramarital
affairs, one of which may have been with Lawrence Selden. She is
described as a nasty woman who enjoys making other people miserable, especially
her own husband. She invites Lily on a cruise with her, her husband,
and Ned Silverton around the Mediterranean, but only so Lily will
distract George while Bertha has an affair with Ned. Bertha, the
novel's antagonist, spreads the rumor that Lily and George are having
an affair, then uses her money and influence to keep Lily out of
society forever.
