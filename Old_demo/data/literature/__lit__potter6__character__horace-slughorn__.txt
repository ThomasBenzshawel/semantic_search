An unlikely candidate for a teaching position at Hogwarts,
				Horace Slughorn is a strange, hopelessly self-serving professor.
				Although Slughorn’s intentions are usually good, and his behavior
				is almost always harmless, he has extreme difficulty seeing past
				his own needs and desires. Occasionally, Slughorn’s greediness works
				out for the best. When Draco sends a bottle of poisoned Mead intended
				for Dumbledore, Slughorn keeps it for himself. Ron ends up getting
				sick from the drink but is saved by Harry, and Slughorn inadvertently prevents
				Dumbledore from being poisoned. Slughorn maintains a small group
				of potentially influential wizards (known as the Slug Club) that
				he romances with parties and special meetings. However, if a student
				is of no particular use to Slughorn, as is Ron Weasley, he gives
				that student no attention whatsoever. Slughorn is usually unable
				to remember Ron’s name, but he is quite attentive to Harry and Hermione,
				whom he considers important and potentially useful to him.

As later revealed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve, Slughorn was
				the first to tell Voldemort, then a Slug Club member and Hogwarts
				student named Tom Riddle, about Horcruxes. Slughorn was obviously embarrassed
				by this memory, as it implicated him as being far too carefree with
				the students he considered the most potentially powerful. Slughorn
				concealed and changed the memory but eventually gives up the real
				one, sacrificing his own reputation with Dumbledore to help Harry
				avenge his parents’ death.
