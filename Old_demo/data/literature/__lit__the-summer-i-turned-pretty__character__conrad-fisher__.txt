Conrad is eighteen and about to enter college. He has always been moody compared to his much livelier younger brother, but during the summer when the novel is set, Conrad becomes particularly withdrawn. In the time since Belly last saw Conrad, he quit the football team at school, broke up with his girlfriend, and started smoking. Playing guitar is one of Conrad’s few hobbies, and it is another indication of his solitary, thoughtful nature. His traits and behavior suggest that Conrad is the stereotypical teenage “bad boy”, but his withdrawn nature also hints at vulnerability that he’s hiding from others. As the story progresses, the reader learns that Conrad is aware that his mother’s condition has grown worse and realizes the family will likely lose her soon. Much of what appears to be bad behavior is actually evidence of his emotional turmoil. Instead of sharing his feelings with others, he withdraws into himself. 

  Conrad idolizes his father. As a result, he is particularly hard hit by the news that his parents are separating. Conrad obviously wants his parents to stay together, but he also struggles with the realization that his father, who has always been his hero, has not taken care of his mother during her illness. In addition, Conrad feels conflicted by his feelings for Belly. He both pulls her close and attempts to push her away.
