On the Origin of Species (which is sometimes shortened to The Origin of Species) is a work of scientific literature by English naturalist Charles Darwin that was first published in 1859. Although acceptance of Darwin’s ideas was slow at first, it is today recognized as the cornerstone of the field of evolutionary biology. The work’s complete title as published by Darwin in 1859—On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in Struggle for Life—gives a good, concise description of its contents.
