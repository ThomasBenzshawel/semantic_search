The Good Soldier is a proto-Modernist novel by English author Ford Madox Ford that was first published in 1915. Its pitiless portrait of an amoral late-Edwardian society dedicated to its own pleasure and convinced of its own superiority outraged many readers. Jokingly called, “the best French novel in the English language,” The Good Soldier is both tragic and darkly comic, and it established Ford as an important contributor to the development of literary Modernism.
