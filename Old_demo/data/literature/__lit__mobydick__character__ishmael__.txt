Despite his centrality to the story, Ishmael doesn’t reveal
				much about himself to the reader. We know that he has gone to sea
				out of some deep spiritual malaise and that shipping aboard a whaler
				is his version of committing suicide—he believes that men aboard
				a whaling ship are lost to the world. It is apparent from Ishmael’s
				frequent digressions on a wide range of subjects—from art, geology,
				and anatomy to legal codes and literature—that he is intelligent
				and well educated, yet he claims that a whaling ship has been “[his]
				Yale College and [his] Harvard.” He seems to be a self-taught
				Renaissance man, good at everything but committed to nothing. Given
				the mythic, romantic aspects of Moby-Dick, it is
				perhaps fitting that its narrator should be an enigma: not everything
				in a story so dependent on fate and the seemingly supernatural needs
				to make perfect sense.

Additionally, Ishmael represents the fundamental contradiction between
				the story of Moby-Dick and its setting. Melville
				has created a profound and philosophically complicated tale and
				set it in a world of largely uneducated working-class men; Ishmael,
				thus, seems less a real character than an instrument of the author.
				No one else aboard the Pequod possesses the proper
				combination of intellect and experience to tell this story. Indeed,
				at times even Ishmael fails Melville’s purposes, and he disappears
				from the story for long stretches, replaced by dramatic dialogues
				and soliloquies from Ahab and other characters.
