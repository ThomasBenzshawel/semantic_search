As the younger son of a noble, Rawdon will never inherit, but because his wealthy aunt took a liking to him, he has been raised in the manner of a young man who will come into money. Rawdon marries Becky because she makes him fall in love with her. He cannot conceive of what his life would be like if he were to lose the support of his benefactress. By the time of Rawdonâ€™s disinheritance, he has no skills to earn money other than gambling on cards and billiards. Rawdon is lazy and unambitious, but he experiences growth when he becomes a father. He willingly makes sacrifices for Rawdy, such as sending him away to a good school, even though he would prefer to have his son at home, and later even taking a job far away and leaving Rawdy with family.
