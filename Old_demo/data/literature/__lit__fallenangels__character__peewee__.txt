Hailing from the brutal streets of the Chicago ghettos,
				Peewee has learned to respond to fear with a brash humor that either
				disarms or infuriates anyone who meets him. When Richie first meets
				Peewee during the trip to Vietnam, Peewee seems arrogant, flippant,
				and even slightly insane. As the two boys share the experiences
				of war, however, Richie realizes that Peewee is actually deeply
				caring, kind, loyal, and tender. While never wholly abandoning his
				bluster and jokes, Peewee reveals his true self more often as the
				months drag on, most strikingly after he watches a mother sacrifice
				her own child in the war effort.

Of all the members of the squad, Peewee best illustrates
				the odd mixture of boy and man that makes up a soldier. He arrives
				in Vietnam claiming to have only three goals in life: to drink wine
				from a corked bottle, to smoke a cigar, and to make love to a foreign woman.
				Yet later, Peewee also hopes to become the stepfather to his girlfriend’s
				daughter. He is still unable to grow a mustache, and he naïvely
				puts lotion on his lip to speed its growth. However boyish he is,
				he also must fight for his country, and he bravely and calmly saves another
				soldier, Monaco, from death. Like Richie, Peewee leaves Vietnam
				no closer to figuring out his future, but closer to becoming a man.
