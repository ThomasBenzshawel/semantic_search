Now, in the warm lamplit room, with all
						its ancient implications of conformity and order, she seemed infinitely
						farther away from him and more unapproachable.	

After supper, Mattie clears up while Ethan takes a last
					turn around the yard. He returns to the kitchen to find Mattie busy
					at her sewing. Taking up his pipe, he sits down contentedly by the
					stove. When Ethan calls Mattie in to join him, she sits in Zeena’s
					rocking chair, and Ethan suddenly imagines the specter of Zeena’s
					face to have appeared in place of Mattie’s features. Perhaps sensing
					her companion’s unease and feeling uneasy herself, Mattie returns
					to her station in the kitchen. In time, Ethan and Mattie’s disquiet
					begins to melt away, and they begin a carefree conversation about
					everyday matters—including, once again, the possibility of going
					sledding on the next moonlit night. However, when Ethan brings up
					his sighting of Ned and Ruth kissing among the spruces, Mattie suddenly becomes silent.

Once again, Ethan and Mattie find themselves avoiding
					the subject that is on both of their minds—their relationship. Ethan
					discusses Mattie’s marriage prospects, and Mattie discusses Zeena’s
					ill will toward her. Dismissing the subject of Zeena, they fall
					silent again, until Ethan boldly places his hand on the opposite
					end of the piece of cloth on which Mattie is working. Mattie, in
					recognition of this gesture, ceases her activity and waits.

The stillness is interrupted by a clatter. Behind Ethan
					and Mattie, the cat has leapt from Zeena’s rocking chair in pursuit
					of a stray mouse. This sudden reminder of Zeena oppresses Ethan,
					and he impulsively picks up his end of Mattie’s sewing work and
					kisses it gently. As he does so, the fabric slips from his hold,
					and he looks up to see Mattie putting away her sewing kit for the
					evening. The clock strikes eleven. Mattie asks about the fire, and
					after straightening up the room, she lights a candle and blows out
					the lamp. As she prepares to climb the stairs, Ethan says goodnight
					to her, and she responds in kind. Ethan, hearing the door to her
					room pull shut, realizes that he has not even touched Mattie’s hand
					during the course of the evening.

At breakfast the following morning, Jotham Powell sits
					between Ethan and Mattie. Overnight, the wet snow has turned to
					sleet, creating poor road conditions and giving the men cause to
					load the remaining lumber at once, but delay their last actual haul
					until the afternoon. When Powell heads out to harness up the horses,
					Ethan and Mattie are left alone again, and Ethan has an urge to
					say, “We shall never be alone again like this.” He stifles it, however,
					and settles for telling her that he will be home for dinner.

In town, after unloading the lumber, Ethan heads to the
					Eady store in search of some glue to fix Zeena’s broken dish, but
					he can’t find any there. Ethan then hastily goes to the widow Homan’s
					store, where, after a lengthy search, he finally finds a single
					bottle of glue. In a driving rain, Ethan pushes his team of horses
					furiously toward home. When he arrives, he puts them away without
					a thought and dashes into the kitchen.

Ethan triumphantly announces to Mattie that he has obtained the
					glue, but his excitement quickly dissipates when Mattie whispers
					that Zeena has returned—she has headed upstairs to her room without
					so much as a word to Mattie. Out at the barn, while Ethan feeds
					the horses, Powell returns to put away the sleigh. Ethan invites him
					to stay for supper, but Powell declines. His refusal throws Ethan into
					a fit of unease, and he is filled with foreboding as he goes back inside,
					where Mattie tells him that dinner is ready.

In the midst of Ethan and Mattie’s unspoken feelings for
					one another, Zeena seems almost supernaturally present. For example, when
					Mattie vacates Zeena’s chair uneasily, it continues to rock for a
					few moments, as though Zeena has reoccupied it. The mischievous cat
					seems to represent its absent owner, doing everything in its power
					to remind Mattie and Ethan of their obligations to Zeena. The cat
					creates general chaos by hopping up into Zeena’s seat at supper
					and upsetting the pickle dish; later, as if to solidify its role
					as Zeena’s ambassador, the cat jumps up into her place and watches the
					would-be couple with suspicious eyes. Ethan himself introduces Zeena
					into the room when, as Mattie sits in Zeena’s rocking chair, he
					mentally transposes Zeena’s face onto Mattie’s body. This act reveals
					Ethan’s subconscious desires and fears—although he wishes for Mattie
					to assume a marital role with him, he also lives in anguished torment
					with regard to the consequences, which embody themselves fully in
					the fearful appearance of Zeena’s ghostly visage.

In the close confines of the familiar, lived-in room,
					Ethan feels trapped and paralyzed by a realm of conventions in which
					Mattie seems infinitely out of reach. His home carries associations
					of conformity, convention, and moral order, which stunt his and
					Mattie’s conversation. This stilted conversation contrasts sharply
					with the free-flowing, easy conversation Ethan and Mattie enjoyed
					the evening before, during their nighttime walk. Ethan’s attempt
					to overcome his shyness is, in a sense, conducted for its own sake,
					in revolt against the societal strictures that limit him. In the
					unshakable silence, Ethan’s shy kiss of Mattie’s sewing work is
					a strictly symbolic gesture, a desperate attempt to act on his emotions—to prove
					to himself that he is capable of doing so. When Mattie blushes at
					the mention of Ruth and Ned as lovers, she acknowledges the sexual
					tension between herself and Ethan, yet she too feels powerless to take
					any real action.

The subject of sledding is raised a second time in Chapter
					V, and again it is associated with death. “There’s an ugly corner
					down by the big elm,” Ethan says. “If a fellow didn’t keep his eyes
					open he’d go plumb into it.” This assessment is foreshadowing with
					a vengeance, since the story ends with Mattie and Ethan sledding
					into that same tree, and Wharton almost seems to be hammering the reader
					over the head with the information.

Jotham Powell’s presence at breakfast in the morning tempers the
					tension between Ethan and Mattie. Not only is Jotham another body
					in the room, but, as Ethan’s hired hand, Jotham symbolizes the workaday
					world that stands between Ethan and his dream. Significantly, during
					Ethan’s village journey of the previous afternoon, it is Powell,
					not Denis Eady, who visits Mattie after delivering Zeena to her
					train. Eady has been positioned several times as a possible obstacle
					to a union between Mattie and Ethan, but the true obstacle is not some
					intrigue on Mattie’s part, but the everyday world. If Mattie is unreachable,
					the reason is not, as Ethan fantasizes, Denis Eady.

Powell’s neutralizing presence, so unwanted during Zeena’s absence,
					suddenly becomes desirable to Ethan after his wife’s return. For
					this reason, Ethan extends a dinner invitation to Powell, hoping
					to diffuse the tension between him and the two women. Powell’s puzzlingly
					abrupt refusal adds an air of impending disaster to the upcoming
					meal. The total change in the household’s atmosphere is further
					registered when Mattie speaks again: her simple statement that she
					supposes it is time for supper bears an entirely different set of
					nuances than the same words held only twenty-four hours before.
