					Margaret and Helen discuss Margaret's
					engagement to Henry; Helen admits that she
					does not like him, but promises to try to be civil to
					him.  Margaret travels with Henry to Hilton, where
					they dine with Charles and Dolly, then take
					an excursion to Howards End.  When they arrive, they
					realize that they have forgotten the key, and
					Margaret is left alone on the porch in a driving rain
					while Henry goes back to get it.  She tries the door
					and discovers that it is unlocked; it is the first
					time she has ever been to Howards End, and as she
					looks through the empty house she thinks that it,
					like the giant wych-elm in the yard, is like England.
					It is so English that neither Henry nor her artistic
					friends would be able to understand it.  As she opens
					the door to the stairs, she is startled to find an
					old woman coming down them: It is Miss Avery, a
					local spinster who says that Margaret frightened
					her.  She thought that Margaret was Mrs. Wilcox's
					ghost.
				


					Evie is annoyed and a little petulant about her
					father's engagement, and moves her own wedding up to
					August to distract herself.  Margaret travels with
					Henry and some Wilcox family friends out to Oniton,
					where the Wilcoxes have recently rented an ancient
					estate (which Henry is already anxious to liquidate).
					A train trip is followed by a car trip; suddenly
					Margaret's car stops, and the men unload all the
					women and force them into the second car.  Margaret
					demands to know what is happening, and learns that
					their car has hit a dog.  Margaret demands to be let
					out so that she can return to the scene, but
					Charles patronizingly refuses to stop--it is
					nothing that a woman should see, he says.  Furious,
					Margaret jumps out of the car, injuring her left hand
					in the process.  As she approaches the scene, she
					learns that the car did not hit a dog; it hit a cat.
					Feeling foolish, she apologizes for jumping from the
					car, and tells Henry that she has been silly, knowing
					that he will chalk up her behavior to feminine
					nervousness.
				


					After Evie's forgettable wedding, the bride and groom
					are driven away to their honeymoon, and Margaret and
					Henry return to the Oniton manor.  Here, they find a
					trio of scraggly looking people waiting at the porch;
					Henry thinks they must be townsfolk, and Margaret
					promises to see that they leave.  When she
					approaches, she is shocked to see Helen,
					accompanied by Leonard and Jacky Bast.  Helen
					indignantly claims that Leonard has lost his job at
					the bank and is destitute; she says that it is all
					their fault, because they advised him to leave the
					Porphyrion.  Margaret is annoyed with Helen for
					having dragged the Basts out to the country, but
					agrees to speak to Henry about giving Leonard a job.
					She asks him indirectly, and he agrees to speak to
					Leonard.  When he approaches, however, the drunken
					Jacky calls him "Hen" and asks if he loves her.
					Margaret is embarrassed, but Henry seems excessively
					humiliated and awkward; he angrily tells Margaret
					that her plan has worked, and that she is released
					from their engagement.  Confused, Margaret presses
					the matter and discovers that 10 years ago Jacky
					was Henry's mistress.  Henry believes Margaret
					dragged the Basts down to Oniton to expose his
					secret.  But Margaret is not interested in Henry's
					humiliation and suspicion.  This is not her tragedy,
					she thinks, but Mrs. Wilcox's.
				


					The main narrative event of this section, obviously,
					is the revelation that Henry has had an
					affair with Jacky.  This not only serves
					further to tangle the histories and fates of the
					three main symbolic groups of the novel (the
					idealistic upper-class Schlegels, the materialistic
					upper-class Wilcoxes, and the destitute lower-class
					Basts), it serves to introduce into the second half
					of the novel a major referendum on sexual mores and
					gender attitudes in early 20th century England.
					Margaret's plunge into a heightened consideration
					of gender relations began in earnest when she became
					engaged to Henry, who holds extremely
					conventional views about the role of men and women.
					It reaches an early climax in this section when
					Margaret leaps out of the moving car in defiance of
					Charles' orders, determined to decide for herself
					what she will do and where she will go, regardless of
					the opinion of men.
				


					The emergence of Jacky as a former lover of
					Henry--and, by heavy implication, as a former prostitute
					(consider also Leonard's family's
					scandalized response to his marriage to Jacky)--does
					not assume its full symbolic significance in this
					section, but will before the end of the novel.
					By and large, this section is devoted mainly to
					foreshadowing key events.  Jacky's revelation,
					Helen's highly agitated mental state, and Miss
					Avery's insistence that Margaret will soon come to
					live at Howards End all predict major development to
					come in the novel.  Helen's imbalance predicts her
					coming sexual encounter with Leonard, Miss Avery's
					weird prophecy predicts the fact that Margaret
					will soon move into Howards End, and Jacky's
					revelation foreshadows the eventual exposure of Henry's
					hypocrisy and his collapse.
				


					Another crucial moment in this section comes in
					Chapter 24, when Margaret, "starting from Howards
					End, attempted to realize England."  Howards End has
					already been suggested as an important symbol for
					England itself, but in this chapter, its symbolic
					role in the novel becomes explicit.  The question of
					"Who will inherit England?" begins to revolve around
					the various characters' relationships to Howards End:
					Margaret's awakening love for the house (and her
					awakening love of England), Henry's indifference to
					it, and Charles and the other Wilcox children's
					strange though possessive distaste for it.  Each
					aspect of Howards End--its position halfway
					between a rural environment and an urban environment;
					its past as a farm; and its status as a former home
					to Mrs. Wilcox, a character who evokes the past
					of England--becomes metaphoric.  Those elements
					parallel the condition of the England at that time,
					which was in a process of transition from a rural,
					farm-based economy to an urban way of life
					(symbolized by the ominous flats being constructed
					all around Wickham Place).
