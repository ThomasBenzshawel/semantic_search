House Made of Dawn is a novel by Kiowa poet and author N. Scott Momaday that was first published in 1968, when Native American novels were rarely published. It is a narrative of a young Native American named Abel who is caught between two worlds—his native heritage on the reservation and the industrialized world of contemporary America in Los Angeles. Momaday’s portrayal of Abel describes the difficulties experienced of many young Native Americans during the 20th century—including relocation efforts, the struggle to enter the industrial work force, the isolation of reservations, and the harmful effects of alcoholism.

In 1969 Momaday won the Pulitzer for Fiction for House Made of Dawn, becoming the first Native American to win the award. The novel and other works by Momaday have been credited with helping to open doors for subsequent Native American writers including Louise Erdich and Leslie Marmon Silko, and Joy Harjo.
