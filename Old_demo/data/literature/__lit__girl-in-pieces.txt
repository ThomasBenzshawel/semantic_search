Katherine Glasgow’s 2016 debut novel Girl in Pieces captures a contemporary American teenage experience of isolation and angst from the perspective of a girl who has dropped out of high school and left home. The New York Times bestseller tells the story of an adolescent girl’s transition from a traumatized teenage runaway to a young adult seeking a path to recovery and independence while struggling with addiction, recovery, and self-harm.
