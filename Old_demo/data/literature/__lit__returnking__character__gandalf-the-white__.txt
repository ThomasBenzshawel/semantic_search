Gandalf is a formidable and intimidating Wizard who uses
				his powers sparingly and cares primarily for the individuals around
				him. He takes Pippin with him to Minas Tirith, as though both he
				and the hobbit might soften each other’s behavior. Gandalf spends
				each night answering Pippin’s unending questions and allaying the
				hobbit’s fears. The wizard is patient and stern with Pippin, but
				he always has time to listen to the hobbit, and he values Pippin’s
				perspective on the Steward of Gondor. Gandalf’s attention remains divided
				between the political and the private, between the cosmic future
				of Middle-earth and the immediate personal needs of those around
				him. Tolkien uses Gandalf to establish the importance of redemption
				in the novel, showing that present, personal dilemmas always supercede
				responsibility to the larger, mystical crises of the world. For
				instance, Gandalf turns from rebuking the Black Captain of Mordor
				at the city gates to deal with the crazed Denethor, who has locked
				himself in the Citadel to attempt suicide.

Like Frodo, Gandalf—whom we later learn is a bearer of
				one of the three lesser Rings—distinguishes himself from the evil
				Sauron in that he does not perceive his life or destiny to be fixed.
				Sauron has limited himself to evil, and evil has become for him
				a necessary logic. Gandalf rarely plays the role of the enchanting
				wizard, and he uses his power sparingly. Rather, Gandalf uses his
				wisdom to imagine new possibilities in his counsel to others, offering
				others redemption by imagining their potential for good. Gandalf
				believes that it is possible for even the Lieutenant of Mordor or
				the dejected Saruman to turn from their evil ways and follow a new,
				unexpected path.
