Metias is handsome, successful, mature, and dutiful. He is one of the Republic’s top soldiers. After their parents’ death, Metias assumes the role of primary caretaker of his sister June, which he takes very seriously. He gets frustrated with June’s rebellious streak and reprimands her whenever he picks her up from the Dean’s office, like any good parent. However, Metias also understands the value of breaking the rules sometimes, especially when it is in the service of some higher goal. He tells June that her breaking the rules to practice her climbing skills is in some ways justifiable. Metias doesn’t follow the Republic slavishly like Thomas, but with some understanding and critical thinking. He also has a conscience and a heart. When Metias is forced to kill a girl trying to escape her Trial, Metias has a serious moment of inner conflict. He resigns from his position and asks to be transferred, thinking about his sister and if she were the girl instead. Metias also doesn’t try to kill Day immediately when he apprehends him, asking to talk first, even though this act puts him in danger. Whenever he hears June speak disparagingly of the poor, he reprimands her, telling her to have compassion. Metias is a noble figure.
