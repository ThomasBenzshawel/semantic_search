Like Rukmani, Nathan identifies with the sustaining and replenishing
				earth. As a young husband, he thrives on the hope of one day owning land.
				However, with each passing year, the tannery gains ascendancy over the rural
				landscape, and his hope diminishes. Nathan is heartbroken when his sons
				repudiate a farmerâ€™s life and turn to other occupations, yet he refuses to ask
				any of them to sacrifice their hopes for a better future. Despite bitter times,
				Nathan is capable of great happiness and joy, and the prospect of a good harvest
				renews his spirit. He dances joyously with his sons at the Festival of Lights
				and loves Rukmani passionately. Often he praises her cleverness and calls her
				the best of wives. Like Rukmani, Nathan is not perfect. His secret infidelity
				with Kunthi early in his marriage fills him with shame and regret until he
				confesses to Rukmani and earns her forgiveness. Rukmani describes Nathan as an
				upright man. He will not eat the food his daughter procures from prostituting
				herself, nor will he fight like an animal for food at the temple as others do.
				At his death, the flame atop the temple goes out as his soul is liberated from
				his suffering body. Like the land he loves, Nathan exemplifies spiritual
				harmony.
