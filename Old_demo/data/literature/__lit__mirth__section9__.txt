Lily, after deciding to leave Mrs. Hatch, moves into a
boarding house by herself, and takes a job as a milliner (a maker
of women's hats). She now finds herself officially divorced from
society and a regular member of the working class.

Lily, however, has trouble at work when her co-workers
ostracize her as a member of the upper-class who has fallen from
her high position. Lily is so worried about her situation that she
begins taking sleeping medication (described as "her only hope of
renewal") to help her rest at night, although the medicine she buys
is particularly strong and should not be consumed in large doses.
On her way home one day, she falls into a complete daze, in which
she meets Rosedale once again. He walks her home, and after a pleasant
conversation together, she tells him that she'd be glad if he were
to visit often. Her relationship with Rosedale has finally become
friendly.

However, all is not well. In April, Lily is fired from
her job for poor performance and attendance. Rosedale visits her
again, and she admits to him that she has joined the working class
with little hope of social uplift. Rosedale desperately wants to
help her, but she refuses his offer of money. Wandering aimlessly
around town, Lily feels totally hopeless, until she formulates a
plan. She goes home to get the collection of letters from her desk,
then goes to visit Selden. She apologizes to him for her rude behavior
at Mrs. Hatch's house, then tells him that she has left the Emporium.
Although she tries to control herself, Lily breaks down into tears
in front of Selden, who comforts her. She cryptically tells him
that they will not see each other for a long time, and she thanks
him for always supporting her in her times of trouble. She confesses
that she has passed up too many opportunities in life, and she professes
that "life is difficult." Selden tells her she must tell him what
her plans are, but Lily says nothing. They know that they love one
another, and Lily tells Selden that the "old Lily" will forever
be with him. She then subtly drops the package of Bertha's letters
into Selden's fire and bids him goodbye.

By this point, the novel is beginning to wind down toward
its end. Wharton begins to build capstones on some of her major
themes and motifs. She continues her ironic symbolism with the bottle
of sleeping medicine; although the bottle is designed to help Lily,
it ends up being the thing that kills her.

Toward the end of the novel, some Darwinian themes appear once
again. In Chapter 11, Lily thinks of herself
as a highly specialized creature designed for life among the upper
classes. Her job among the working classes removes her from what
she perceives to be her biological element; she uses the theories
of Darwin to account for her own instincts and behavior.

At this point in the novel, we begin to see more clearly
the parallel structure of the narrative. Lily, at the end of Chapter 11,
thinks back to where she was two years ago, at the beginning of
the novel. It is important to notice how many events from Book One
have corresponding events in Book Two. For instance, the novel opens
with an interaction between her and Selden; it ends the same way.
Book One shows how Lily succeeds in society despite her increasing
debt; Book Two shows her fall from society because of her increasing debt.
Luck factors prominently into both books as well. In the first, it
leads Lily to lose extensive amounts of money at cards; and in the second,
bad luck causes her expulsion from society when she happens to be
seen in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong man.
