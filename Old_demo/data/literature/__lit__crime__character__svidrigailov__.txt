Svidrigailov is one of the most enigmatic characters in Crime
					and Punishment. Dostoevsky leaves little doubt as to Svidrigailov’s
				status as a villain. But all of Svidrigailov’s crimes, except for
				his attempted rape of Dunya, are behind him. We witness Svidrigailov perform
				goods deeds, such as giving money to the family of his fiancée,
				to Katerina Ivanovna and her children, and to Dunya. Although he
				is a violent and sneaky individual, Svidrigailov possesses the ability
				to accept that he cannot force reality to conform to his deepest desires.
				In this regard, he functions as a foil to Raskolnikov, who can accept
				only partially the breakdown of his presumed “superman” identity.
				Further, whereas Raskolnikov believes unflinchingly in the utilitarian
				rationale for Alyona Ivanovna’s murder, Svidrigailov doesn’t try
				to contest the death of his romantic vision when Dunya rejects him.
				Although the painful realization that he will never have the love
				of someone as honest, kind, intelligent, and beautiful as she is
				compels him to commit suicide, he is one of the few characters in the
				novel to die with dignity.
