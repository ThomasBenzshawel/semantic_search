Valerian dominates the other characters. A wealthy man,
				he employs most of the black characters, including Sydney, Ondine, Gideon,
				and Thérèse. He plays patron to Jadine, paying for her education
				in Paris, and also sometimes acts like a father figure to Son. Margaret’s
				marriage to Valerian saved her from a hardscrabble life in Maine.
				Though she hates life on the island, Valerian refuses to return
				to the United States. These economic connections make the other
				characters subservient to Valerian: They must listen to what he
				says, because he controls the purse strings. Valerian’s high degree of
				power is symbolized by his greenhouse: There, he controls which plants
				live and which plants die. He seems to have created the life he has
				always wanted on Isle des Chevaliers.

But as Tar Baby continues, Valerian loses
				power and control. By the end of the novel, he has weakened to the
				point of vulnerability and senility. The news about Margaret’s abuse
				of their son totally incapacitates Valerian, in part because he
				realizes just how little control he ever exerted over people in
				his life. He was a powerful businessman, but he lacked the power
				to create a loving environment for his wife and son, and he was
				powerless to stop Margaret’s horrible tendencies. Morrison reflects
				his weakened position through the novel’s narrative structure. Whereas
				the first part of the novel explores Valerian’s memories and present-day
				perspective, the final section barely touches on Valerian. He becomes
				almost invisible, a representation of his diminished stature.
