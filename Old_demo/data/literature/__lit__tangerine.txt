Tangerine, Edward Bloor’s first novel, was met with critical acclaim and named one of the “Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults” by the American Library Association in 1997. The coming-of-age story follows twelve-year-old Paul Fisher as he and his family move to Tangerine County, Florida—a place where dark secrets and upheaval are never very far from surfacing. Tangerine centers on Paul’s relationship with his high school football-star older brother Erik as it explores topics including disabilities, bullying, discrimination, the environment, and courage.
