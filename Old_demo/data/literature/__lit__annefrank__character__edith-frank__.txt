Anne has very little sympathy for her mother during their
				tumultuous years in the annex, and she has few kind words to say
				about her, particularly in the earlier entries. Anne feels that
				her mother is cold, critical, and uncaring, that they have very
				little in common, and that her mother does not know how to show
				love to her children. Like Margot, Mrs. Frank is mentioned almost
				exclusively in instances when she is the source of Anne’s anger
				and frustration. Anne rarely comments on her mother’s positive traits.

Later in her diary, however, Anne attempts to look at
				her mother’s life as a wife and mother from a more objective viewpoint. As
				Anne gets older and gains a clearer perspective, she begins to regret
				her quick, petty judgments of her mother. Anne has more sympathetic
				feelings for Mrs. Frank and begins to realize how Mrs. Frank’s gender
				and entrapment in the annex have created many obstacles for her.
				Despite her new perspective, Anne continues to feel estranged from
				her sentimental, critical mother and irrevocably deems her unfit.
				It seems that Mrs. Frank’s inability to provide emotional support
				for her daughter stems in part from the stress and pain of the persecution
				and forced confinement. Because the diary consists of only Anne’s
				thoughts and perspectives, we are never able to gain much insight
				into Mrs. Frank’s own personal thoughts or feelings.
