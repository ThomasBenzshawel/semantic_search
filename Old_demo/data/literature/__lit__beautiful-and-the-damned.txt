The Beautiful and Damned, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s second novel, was published in 1922. It explores the lives and lifestyles of New York’s high society during the Jazz Age and around World War I. The novel is loosely inspired by the early years of Fitzgerald’s marriage with his wife Zelda. In a satirical review for the New York Tribune, Zelda wrote that her husband seemed to believe that plagiarism begins at home and that he borrowed heavily from her diaries and letters. The unraveling of the novel’s protagonists mirrored aspects of Fitzgerald’s life and his struggles with alcoholism.
