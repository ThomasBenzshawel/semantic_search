Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly is the 2016 nonfiction account of the Black women who worked as human “computers” at NACA and NASA from the 1930s to the 1960s. It chronicles the lives and achievements of three Black women — Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson — and the racism and gender discrimination they overcame during World War II, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Space Race. Critically and commercially successful, Hidden Figures was adapted into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2016. The research accounted for in the book helped bring the accomplishments of these three previously little-known women to light.
