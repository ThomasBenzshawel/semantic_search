"To Build a Fire"Â is a short story by Jack London that was first published in 1902 and later republished in 1908 with a different ending. The story follows an unnamed protagonist as he attempts to travel through the Yukon Territory on a bitterly cold winter day. Ignoring warnings about the extreme cold, he faces a brutal struggle for survival as nature turns against him. London's narrative highlights the unforgiving power of the wilderness and the consequences of human arrogance in the face of nature's indifference.
