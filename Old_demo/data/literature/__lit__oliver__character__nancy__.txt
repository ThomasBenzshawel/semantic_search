A major concern of Oliver Twist is the
				question of whether a bad environment can irrevocably poison someone’s
				character and soul. As the novel progresses, the character who best
				illustrates the contradictory issues brought up by that question
				is Nancy. As a child of the streets, Nancy has been a thief and
				drinks to excess. The narrator’s reference to her “free and agreeable
				. . . manners” indicates that she is a prostitute. She is immersed
				in the vices condemned by her society, but she also commits perhaps
				the most noble act in the novel when she sacrifices her own life
				in order to protect Oliver. Nancy’s moral complexity is unique among
				the major characters in Oliver Twist. The novel
				is full of characters who are all good and can barely comprehend
				evil, such as Oliver, Rose, and Brownlow; and characters who are
				all evil and can barely comprehend good, such as Fagin, Sikes, and
				Monks. Only Nancy comprehends and is capable of both good and evil.
				Her ultimate choice to do good at a great personal cost is a strong
				argument in favor of the incorruptibility of basic goodness, no
				matter how many environmental obstacles it may face.

	Nancy’s love for Sikes exemplifies the moral ambiguity
				of her character. As she herself points out to Rose, devotion to
				a man can be “a comfort and a pride” under the right circumstances.
				But for Nancy, such devotion is “a new means of violence and suffering”—indeed,
				her relationship with Sikes leads her to criminal acts for his sake
				and eventually to her own demise. The same behavior, in different
				circumstances, can have very different consequences and moral significance.
				In much of Oliver Twist, morality and nobility
				are black-and-white issues, but Nancy’s character suggests that
				the boundary between virtue and vice is not always clearly drawn.
