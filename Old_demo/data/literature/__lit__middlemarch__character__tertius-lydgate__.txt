Lydgate enters Middlemarch as the bright, cutting-edge
				handsome new doctor. Although he is of high birth, Lydgate wants
				to be a country doctor. Lydgateâ€™s desire is not entirely selfless,
				but he is genuinely interested in helping others. He is motivated
				by the desire to reform medical practices, and he symbolizes change
				and reform coming to Middlemarch. At first, things go well for Lydgate.
				His practice grows, he starts a new hospital, and he gains a reputation
				as a good doctor with patients of high social and financial standing. But
				when he abruptly falls in love with Rosamond, things begin to go
				downhill rapidly. Marriage ruins Lydgate, both financially and idealistically.
				As he gets further and further into debt, his personality changes,
				vacillating between coddling and soothing Rosamond and feeling intense
				bitterness toward her. The financial burden of marriage comes between
				him and his desire to reform the provincial medical practices of
				the neighborhood. In addition to his debts, the scandal of Raffles
				death marks him as an accomplice to murder.
