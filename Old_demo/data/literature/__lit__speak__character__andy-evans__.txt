Andy Evans is the story’s antagonist. A rich and popular student who attends Melinda's high school, he is also Melinda's rapist. For the first quarter of the book, it's unclear what happened to Melinda. One of the first clues the reader receives is the appearance of a boy she calls "IT" at the end of the first marking period. It's not until midway through the book Melinda reveals his full name as Andy Evans and describes him in detail. The fact that she exclusively calls him “IT” long before the reader learns his actual name suggests he is less than human, and a monster.

Because Andy is never publicly accused, many girls don't believe the rumors, and those who speak out are silenced. Andy harasses Melinda whenever he gets a chance. He twists her ponytail in the cafeteria, blows in her ear in detention, and jumps on her desk in art class, ruining her work. His presence symbolizes the knowledge of what has happened to her—try as she might to forget about it, the memory always resurfaces when she least expects it. Melinda’s intense reaction every time Andy enters her space emphasizes how much his actions have affected her. After Melinda writes a warning about Andy on the girls' bathroom wall, many other girls share similar experiences with him, confirming his predatory behavior and finally allowing Melinda at least a fraction of the validation and support she needs.

When Andy begins to pursue Melinda’s former best friend Rachel, it marks a change in Melinda. She begins to occupy an active role in her own life as she struggles to convince Rachel that Andy is dangerous. Her transformation from passive observer to active participant culminates in Andy’s second attack in the janitor’s closet, and it’s then that Melinda is able to find her voice and, at last, to speak.
