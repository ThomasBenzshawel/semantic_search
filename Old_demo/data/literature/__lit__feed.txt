Set in a future dystopic America, M.T. Anderson’s YA novel feed explores themes of corporate power, environmental destruction, technology, and loss of individuality. The novel follows the life of first-person narrator, Titus, whose sheltered life changes dramatically when he meets Violet, an unusual girl who wants to defy “the feed”—a global network that connects to brain implants and uses people’s purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings to sell them things. Published in 2002, before the rise of rampant data mining, feed tells a cautionary tale of what can happen if humans fall prey to unchecked consumerism and outsized corporate influence.
