Likely the poem’s most memorable creation, Grendel is
				one of the three monsters that Beowulf battles. His nature is ambiguous. Though
				he has many animal attributes and a grotesque, monstrous appearance,
				he seems to be guided by vaguely human emotions and impulses, and
				he shows more of an interior life than one might expect. Exiled
				to the swamplands outside the boundaries of human society, Grendel
				is an outcast who seems to long to be reinstated. The poet hints
				that behind Grendel’s aggression against the Danes lies loneliness
				and jealousy. By lineage, Grendel is a member of “Cain’s clan, whom
				the creator had outlawed / and condemned as outcasts.” (106–107).
				He is thus descended from a figure who epitomizes resentment and
				malice. While the poet somewhat sympathetically suggests that Grendel’s
				deep bitterness about being excluded from the revelry in the mead-hall
				owes, in part, to his accursed status, he also points out that Grendel
				is “[m]alignant by nature” and that he has “never show[n] remorse”
				(137).
