Carlos agitated against Trujillo's military dictatorship,
				which led to his family's flight from the Dominican Republic to
				the United States. As a doctor, he must face the humiliation of
				having to reestablish his professional reputation and credentials,
				as not being able to provide for his family in the manner they were
				used to back home on the Island. He also has difficulty accepting
				that his daughters will mature and assimilate into American culture.
				He fights with his daughters when they show a spark of independence
				or individuality, and insist that they must behave as Dominican
				women would, even though this is an unrealistic expectation. Because
				he left the Dominican Republic as a mature man, and his daughters
				left when they were young children, he is in many ways culturally
				distinct from them. They have trouble tolerating his Dominican values
				when they clash with the American attitudes they have adopted regarding
				sexuality and gender relations.
