The men are led to a group of trenches where Wilson promptly
					falls asleep. For a time, rumors fly fast and fierce as to the conduct
					of the battle and the activities of the enemy. Briefly, Henry glimpses
					a column of gray-suited enemy soldiers, and his regiment is quickly marched
					into the forest. Henry begins complaining bitterly about his army’s
					leadership, blaming the generals for their failure to win battles.
					When another soldier mocks him, however, Henry falls silent, afraid
					that he will be exposed as a fraud. The lieutenant shepherds the
					men to a spot in the woods, where he says they will encounter the
					enemy in only a few minutes. As the battle roar swells to a thunder,
					the men wearily await the fight.

After a maddening and intense period of waiting for the
					inevitable, the enemy sweeps down upon the line of blue-uniformed
					men. Seized by a feverish hatred of the enemy, Henry fights in a
					frenzy, firing and reloading and refusing to retreat. In the heat
					and smoke, he is aware of nothing but his own rage. After a while,
					he hears one of his comrades laughing and realizes that he is firing
					at nothing; the battle is over, the enemy has fled. His regiment
					now regards Henry with awe, regaling him with stories of his ferocious
					prowess in the combat. The lieutenant tells Henry that if he had
					ten thousand “wildcats” like him, he could win the war in a week.
					Strangely, Henry feels as though he himself had nothing to do with
					his brave exploits; rather, it was as if he fell asleep and woke
					to find himself a knight. The exultant soldiers congratulate one
					another happily, and chatter about how many men the enemy lost in
					the battle. In the bright blue sky, the sun shines gaily, marred
					only by a cloud of dark smoke from the fighting.

Although he has no firsthand knowledge of battle at the
					beginning of this chapter, Henry persists in his self-congratulatory
					and undeservedly condescending behavior by criticizing the generals
					as incompetents. Now that a battle is again imminent, however, some of
					Henry’s comfortable security seems to dissipate. He again begins to
					worry—not about his personal safety this time, but about the possibility
					of being exposed as a fraud. Though he has been willing to let the
					views of his companions determine—and even replace—his own perception
					of truth, Henry remains uncomfortably conscious of the fact that
					he is involved in an elaborate lie.

Though it mainly offers brief, impressionistic snapshots
					of battle and does not deeply involve the main themes of the novel,
					Chapter XVII is, in many ways, the turning point in The
						Red Badge of Courage. Henry’s emotions during this third
					skirmish change from terror to blind rage, and as he fights he becomes
					the wildest and fiercest soldier in the regiment. Again, it is important
					to note that Henry’s transformation has little to do with conventional
					notions of bravery; he does not consciously become a better soldier
					by renewing his commitment to the Union cause and mustering up his
					courage. Instead, his self-awareness—that wellspring of vanity,
					selfishness, and misguided judgments—suddenly vanishes just as it
					did in the first battle. Unlike that engagement, however, Henry
					no longer feels that he is part of a machine. He simply loses himself
					in a wild fury directed at himself for having behaved like a coward,
					at the universe for its indifference, and at the enemy. One can
					argue that even at this point, Henry’s narcissism still serves as
					his primary motivation for behaving like the hero he dreams of being;
					the ideals of the Union army could not compel him to fight as fiercely
					as his own frustration with his earlier gutlessness.

Still, knowledge of his successful participation in battle
					begins to calm Henry’s hypersensitivity to, and dependence on, the
					opinions of his peers. Whereas Henry once eagerly reveled in any
					word of praise from his comrades, even unjustified ones, he now
					seems to distrust their accolades which do not correspond to his
					own recollection of the fighting. He perceives that the reality
					of war does not match its mythology: “By this struggle he had overcome
					obstacles which he had admitted to be mountains. They had fallen
					like paper peaks, and he was now what he called a hero. And he had
					not been aware of the process.” After this battle, Henry is able
					to trust that he has performed real and important deeds. While this
					realization does not restore his belief in the relevance of humanity’s
					arbitrary moral conventions to the indifferent universe, it does
					commence the painstaking process of his maturation, as he feels
					the satisfaction of knowing that he has done right.
