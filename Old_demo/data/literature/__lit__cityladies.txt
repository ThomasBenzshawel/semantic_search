The Book of the City of Ladies, written by Christine de Pizan in 1405, is an allegorical novel that follows the narrator’s journey through a city populated entirely by women. The book was written in response to Jean de Meun’s Romance of the Rose, a text that de Pizan believed perpetuated harmful stereotypes about women. The Book of the City of Ladies is considered one of the earliest works of feminist literature and is notable for its exploration of gender roles and its critique of patriarchal society.
