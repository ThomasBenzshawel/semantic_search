In the 2001 bestseller, Nickel and Dimed, journalist Barbara Ehrenreich investigates the plight of the working poor in America and reports on her stint as an undercover low-wage worker. An earlier version of the work had appeared in Harper’s magazine in 1999. In 2021, a 20th-anniversary edition of the book was released with a new foreword that reveals that many of the unfair social and economic practices Ehrenreich exposed are not only still happening, but some—such as the high cost of housing—have gotten worse. Nickel and Dimed was ranked 13th on The Guardian’s list of 100 best books of the 21st century in 2019.
