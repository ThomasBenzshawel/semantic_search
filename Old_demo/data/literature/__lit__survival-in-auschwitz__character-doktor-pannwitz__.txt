Doktor Pannwitz is an archetype of the German race who challenges Levi's notions about his place in the world. During the interview for the Buna lab position, the civilian scientist's appearance, demeanor, and privilege cause Levi to reflect on his own preconceptions. Pannwitz's genetic characteristics of fair skin, blond hair, and blue eyes mark him as a Teuton, the ancestry prized by the Third Reich. Levi recognizes his own implicit bias that fair hair and blue eyes are inherently malevolent. Pannwitz looks at Levi as if he’s peering through the glass of an aquarium at a different species even though they could be colleagues, sharing the same education in organic chemistry. His cool detachment and position of authority raise Levi's feelings of powerlessness. At the beginning of the interview, Levi confronts his conditioned response that communication with Germans is impossible.

As the interview progresses, Pannwitz uses formal German that shows respect to Levi. He starts from the beginning, asking Levi where he was born. He draws out of Levi the remembered skills of their chemistry profession. Pannwitz asks about the thesis that earned Levi his degree and shows him Gattermann's textbook that Levi also studied, developing an intellectual connection between them. Pannwitz judges Levi on his intelligence—not his appearance—and makes a pragmatic choice to bring Levi into the lab. His decision allows Levi to build a bridge to his former life and restores Levi’s faith in himself. The position spares Levi from hard labor and surely saves his life.
