Unlike the other major characters in the novel, Marius
				grows up in a well-to-do household free of financial worries. Nonetheless,
				his family is split apart by politics, and it is not until he develops
				his own personality that he is able to become whole. Marius’s loyalties
				are torn between his father, Georges Pontmercy, who is a colonel
				in the Napoléonic army, and his staunchly monarchist grandfather,
				M. Gillenormand, who raises him. The political differences between
				his father and grandfather threaten to tear apart Marius’s identity,
				as he learns that his conservative grandfather intentionally prevented
				him from establishing a relationship with his father out of fear
				that Marius would succumb to his father’s liberal political views.
				Angry and confused, Marius adopts his father’s beliefs, but it soon
				becomes apparent that what he really needs is an idealism of his
				own. Marius begins to develop truly only when he leaves Gillenormand’s
				house, finding himself and falling in love for the first time.

Marius is more innocent than the other characters in the
				novel, and while this innocence keeps him from becoming cruel or
				cynical, it also makes him occasionally blind to the problems of
				others. This lack of perception first becomes clear in Marius’s
				treatment of Eponine, and becomes especially unattractive when Marius
				drives Valjean from his house. In the end, Marius is a good person,
				but his inability to perceive the needs or feeling of others can
				at times make him unwittingly malicious.
