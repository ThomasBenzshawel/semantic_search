Godfrey is the eldest son of Squire Cass and the heir
				to the Cass estate. He is a good-natured young man, but weak-willed
				and usually unable to think of much beyond his immediate material
				comfort. As a young man he married an opium addict, Molly Farren, with
				whom he had a daughter. This secret marriage and Godfrey’s handling
				of it demonstrate the mixture of guilt and moral cowardice that
				keep him paralyzed for much of the novel. Godfrey consented to the
				marriage largely out of guilt and keeps the marriage secret because
				he knows his father will disown him if it ever comes to light.

	Despite his physically powerful and graceful presence,
				Godfrey is generally passive. In this respect he is similar to Silas.
				However, Godfrey’s passivity is different from Silas’s, as his endless
				waffling and indecisiveness stem entirely from selfishness. Godfrey
				is subject to constant blackmail from Dunsey, who knows of Godfrey’s
				secret marriage, and Godfrey is finally freed of his malicious brother
				simply by an accident. He is delivered from Molly in a similarly
				fortuitous way, when Molly freezes to death while en route to Raveloe
				to expose their marriage to Godfrey’s family. Even Godfrey’s eventual confession
				to Nancy is motivated simply by his fright after the discovery of
				Dunsey’s remains. This confession comes years too late—by the time
				Godfrey is finally ready to take responsibility for Eppie, she has
				already accepted Silas as her father and does not want to replace
				him in her life.
