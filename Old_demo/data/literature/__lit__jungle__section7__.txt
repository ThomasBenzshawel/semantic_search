Jurgis looks at Antanas’s dead body and leaves the house
					without a word. He walks to the nearest railway crossing and hides
					in a car. During his journey, he fights every sign of grief and
					emotion. He regards his experiences up until now as a lengthy nightmare
					that he has had to endure. He rides the railway car into the country.
					The clean air and space revive him, and he jumps off when the train stops.
					He bathes and washes his clothes in the nearest stream. He tries
					to buy food at a farmhouse but the farmer sends him away because
					he doesn’t feed “tramps.” Jurgis makes his way across the farmer’s
					field, ripping up a hundred young peach trees in response.

Another farmer is kind enough to sell Jurgis a dinner
					and let him sleep in the barn. He offers Jurgis work; Jurgis asks
					if there is enough to last all winter. The farmer says that he can
					guarantee work only through November. Jurgis sarcastically asks
					if he turns his horses out for the winter as well since they are
					useful for only part of the year. The farmer asks why a strong man
					cannot find work in the cities in the winter. Jurgis explains that
					everyone thinks that there must be work in the city in the winter
					and that the cities therefore become overcrowded. As a result, many
					of these laborers end up having to steal and beg in order to survive.
					Jurgis turns down the farmer’s offer of work and continues on his
					way.

Jurgis earns a few meals with odd jobs, stealing and foraging when
					he isn’t working. After a while, he stops asking for shelter from
					farmers because so many are hostile to him. He feels like his own
					master again. He learns a few tricks and secrets from the other tramps
					in the countryside. Farmers are almost frantic for help during this
					season, and work is easy to find. Jurgis works for two weeks and
					receives a sum that he would have earlier considered a fortune. He
					spends all of it on alcohol and women in one night, and his own conscience
					judges him mercilessly for this waste.

Jurgis returns to Chicago in the fall because the cold
					weather is upon him. He finds a job digging underground tunnels
					for railway freight. The purpose of the tunnels is to break the
					power of the teamster’s union, though Jurgis remains unaware of
					this goal for a year. Confident that the job will last all winter,
					he spends his money on alcohol with abandon. Unfortunately, however,
					he suffers an accident and breaks his arm. He spends Christmas in
					the hospital. After two weeks, he is ushered out of the hospital,
					to his dismay. It is the dead of winter. He attends a religious
					revival with other bums just to stay warm. He despises the men preaching
					at the revival since he feels that they have no right to talk about
					saving souls when men like him only need a “decent existence for
					their bodies.”

That winter, work is scarcer than ever before,
					and Jurgis must fiercely compete with the other homeless poor for
					the hiding places and warmth in saloons. One night, while begging,
					he happens upon a very drunk, well-dressed young man named Freddie
					Jones. Jones invites him to his house for a meal and offers to pay
					for the cab ride there. He hands a bill to Jurgis and tells him
					to pay the cabbie and keep the change for himself. Jurgis finds
					that it is a one-hundred-dollar bill. The opulence and luxury of
					Freddie’s mansion astound Jurgis. He learns from Freddie’s drunken
					rambling that he is the son of “Jones the packer.” Jurgis realizes
					that the elder Jones owns the factory where he first worked in Packingtown.
					Freddie gives Jurgis a large dinner despite the obvious disapproval
					of the butler, Hamilton. Once Freddie falls to sleep, Hamilton orders
					Jurgis to leave. Hamilton tries to search him, but Jurgis threatens
					to fight if Hamilton lays a finger on him.

As Sinclair portrays the destruction of the immigrant
					family through the brutal machinery of turn-of-the-century capitalism,
					he continues to focus principally on the development of Jurgis’s
					character. The accumulated tragedies in his life have emptied his
					emotional reserves, as evidenced by his inability to grieve adequately
					for his son. This final blow compels him to abandon the moral and social
					principles (such as loyalty to family) to which he has thus far clung
					and instead adopt the dog-eat-dog values of the world in which he
					lives. According to this new outlook, if someone deals him a blow,
					he deals one back. When the farmer refuses to sell him
					a meal, Jurgis responds by vandalizing his property, tearing up
					his newly planted peach trees. The conditions of poverty and misery
					created by capitalism have annihilated his ability to invest emotionally
					in his family, and he abandons Teta Elzbieta, Marija, and the other
					children because he does not have the emotional reserves to watch
					them sink, either literally or figuratively, into ruin. Without
					this crucial anchor, Jurgis gives himself over to complete debauchery—Sinclair
					again positions capitalism as a threat to fundamental American values.

The religious revival serves as an attack on
					the misdirected efforts of organized religion. Like the misdirected
					philanthropy of the rich woman in Chapter 21, Christianity
					here does nothing to improve the lives of wage laborers. It preaches
					morality but fails to provide the material conditions necessary
					for one to be a moral person.

Jurgis’s encounter with Freddie Jones is obviously meant
					to illustrate the vast difference in standard of living between
					employers and the wage laborers who work for them. Jones is a drunken,
					wasteful fop who hands out one-hundred-dollar bills as if they were
					nothing; he has no conception of the value of money. Moreover, the
					luxury and opulence of Freddie’s home illustrate his father’s extravagant waste
					of the wealth generated through wage slavery. This disparity between
					a laborer such as Jurgis, who has long worked in grueling conditions
					with virtually no reward, and Freddie, who has certainly never had
					to face anything remotely resembling Jurgis’s ghastly reality but
					who nonetheless reaps the benefit of hard work—others’ hard
					work—is a crystal clear manifestation of Sinclair’s advocacy of socialism
					and equal distribution of wealth.

Occasionally, Sinclair’s political fervor overwhelms the
					stylistic constraints that he has set for himself. The realist style
					that Sinclair uses to expose appalling working conditions requires
					consistent adherence throughout the text because deviation from
					it reveals the text to be contrived. The horror of the packing plant
					loses its rhetorical force if other events are not believable. For
					example, Sinclair’s realism falters in the dialogue between Jurgis
					and Freddie. Sinclair renders the speech of the drunken Freddie
					with a consummate, almost exaggerated, realism. He stutters, slurs
					his speech, and wanders from thought to thought. Jurgis’s dialogue,
					conversely, is idealized. When the butler begins to threaten “I’ll
					have the police—”, Jurgis interjects with a clever play on words,
					shouting “Have ’em!” This pun on the word “have” seems beyond the
					language skills of an uneducated Lithuanian immigrant.
					Similarly, Jurgis’s cry, “I’ll not have you touch me!” seems too
					polished for someone of his social status. The inconsistent treatment
					of dialogue in this example mirrors the inconsistent realism in
					the text as a whole. Sinclair places capitalists and capitalism
					under a glaring spotlight and reports every ugly detail; however,
					he spares his protagonist and the working classes realistic treatment
					that might reflect poorly on them. They are often glorified, idealized,
					and flattened into one-dimensional types.
