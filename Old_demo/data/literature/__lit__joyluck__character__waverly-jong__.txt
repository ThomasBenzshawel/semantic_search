From her mother, Waverly inherits her “invisible strength”—her ability
				to conceal her thoughts and strategize. Although she applies these
				to chess as a child, she later turns them on her mother, Lindo, as
				well, imagining her struggles with her mother as a tournament.

Waverly’s focus on invisible strength also contributes
				to a sense of competitiveness: she feels a rivalry with Jing-mei
				and humiliates her in front of the others at Suyuan’s New Year’s
				dinner. Yet Waverly is not entirely self-centered: she loves her
				daughter, Shoshana, unconditionally. Nor is she without insecurities:
				she fears her mother’s criticism of her fiancé, Rich. In fact, it
				seems that Waverly tends to project her fears and dislikes onto
				her mother. As she sits through dinner with her parents and Rich,
				she becomes distraught as she imagines her mother’s growing hatred
				of her fiancé. Yet, later on, she realizes that her mother in fact
				likes Rich—Waverly was the one with the misgivings, perhaps a sort
				of cultural guilt: Rich is white, and Waverly does not like to think
				that she has lost her ties to her Chinese heritage.
