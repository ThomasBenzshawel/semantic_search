The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a 1900 novel by L. Frank Baum. Baum intended the novel to be a modern fairy tale that would entertain readers without offering a moral lesson. It was very popular upon its initial release and has had a large impact on popular culture in the years since. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has inspired many sequels by both Baum and others that describe further adventures in Oz. The novel was adapted into the iconic movie The Wizard of Oz in 1939, the Broadway musical and movie The Wiz in the 1970s, and the novel and musical Wicked in the 1990s.
