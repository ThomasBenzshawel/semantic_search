Though Martha and Sewell meet only rarely during their lifetimes, Sewell’s
				diary is a perfect foil for Martha’s. While Martha builds her life on the
				strength of the people she is connected to and on the worth of her daily
				accomplishments, Sewell’s highest priority is clearly the philosophies and
				ideals he most supports. The funeral of a dead president, merely a local event
				for Martha, becomes for Sewell an opportunity to ruminate on the ideals of the
				new republic and how Washington had served as a symbol for those ideals. Sewell
				has a long and bitter feud going with Isaac Foster and contributes
				wholeheartedly to driving the family out of town, but in none of his entries on
				Foster does Sewell have anything bad to say about the man as a person. The
				entirety of Sewell’s very strong dislike is a disagreement with Foster’s
				religious beliefs. Ideas are Sewell’s focus even when writing about the
				Purrinton murders. His entry about the funeral focuses less on the tragedy than
				on the fact that the preacher is a Methodist. For Sewell, people matter far less
				than what they believe in.
