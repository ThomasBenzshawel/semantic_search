Marie has a childlike ignorance that, paired with her great disappointment
				with life, encourages her to exist in a fantasy world, out of touch with
				reality. When she couldn’t take her miscarriages and her husband’s cheating any
				longer, she escaped her village life for the city. When her life as a maid fails
				to satisfy her, she escapes into a world where the dead baby she finds is her
				living daughter and the household where she works is her own home. Nothing in
				the world matters to her, and the only people she feels close to are the
				imagined ghosts of her dead mother and ancestors. She wants to die so she can
				join them. Marie sees the real world as a cruel place and feels worthless
				because of her inability to have a child and continue her ancestral line. Marie
				is religious and superstitious. She bitterly resents her employers for their
				comfortable lifestyle and their dismissal of her as an ignorant peasant. She
				feels anonymous and knows that no one loves her, which gives her an overwhelming
				sense of despair.
