The director of The Wizard of Oz adds a song for the trees and gives them arm holes, but the play ends up being a disaster. No one knows their lines; from the audience, Manny yells “Bubby!” at Greg; Rodrick appears with a video camera; and when the trees throw apples at Patty Ferrell, they break her glasses, stopping the show. As Christmas approaches, Greg asks for the video game Twisted Wizard, and the family buys a red sweater for a Giving Tree program at church. Greg recalls one Christmas when he asked for a Barbie Dream House to use as a fort and his Uncle Charlie gave him a Barbie doll instead. 

This Christmas morning brings its own disappointments: Greg receives a photo of Uncle Charlie, a L’il Cutie book (a comic Greg hates) from Rodrick, books, and socks. Later, Greg’s dad gives him a bench press, but Greg is no longer interested, and Mom accidentally gives him the red sweater meant for the Giving Tree. Apparently, she bought him Twisted Wizard after all, but the gifts got mixed up since they were wrapped in the same paper. Later that night, Greg gives Rowley the L’il Cutie book and Rowley gives him a child’s Big Wheel. Earlier that day, Rowley got Twisted Wizard, so at least Greg can play it with him. On New Year’s Eve, Greg gets sent to bed early for playing a trick on Manny.
