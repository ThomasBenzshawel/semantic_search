Among her sisters, Rachel stands out initially for her
				beauty, her magnetism, and her magical water smell. “Their father,
				Laban, treats her most gently; as a result, she ends up somewhat
				spoiled and conniving. She is fully aware of the power her beauty
				has over others and is quite willing to use it. She insists on having
				Jacob when she meets him, though she is not yet marriageable and
				would embarrass her two older sisters by marrying first. Then she
				shows herself to be deceptive as well, agreeing to let Leah replace
				her under the bridal veil.

Rachel’s jealous nature flourishes when Leah conceives
				and bears several healthy sons in a row and Rachel remains barren.
				Rachel is not satisfied with being Jacob’s favorite wife—she needs
				more. She compensates for Leah’s fertility by seeking out the calling
				of midwife and finds that she is extremely talented. Her new skills
				help heal her relationship with her sister, though Rachel is not
				satisfied until she bears her own son.

Rachel changes significantly with the birth of her son
				and her growing success as a midwife. She finds a softer, more maternal
				side in her personality and begins to cultivate a more peaceful
				relationship with her sister. She takes delight in her niece, and,
				through Dinah, her relationship with Leah improves further. She
				acts as a midwife mentor to Dinah. Although Rachel improves significantly with
				age and is a talented midwife and healer, she remains primarily a
				jealous and unhappy woman.
