At first, Finnick appears to be little more than an arrogant and self-absorbed scoundrel, to use a somewhat polite term. He’s famous in the Capitol, and indeed all around Panem, for being extremely handsome, a serial womanizer, and for having won the Hunger Games when he was just fourteen. As the novel progresses, it becomes clear that Finnick, much like Katniss, has a public persona that doesn’t match who he really is. As Katniss gets to know Finnick during the Quarter Quell, she sees he is in fact loyal, dutiful, and caring. For example, despite Mags being a burden on his chances of survival, Finnick does everything he can to keep the eighty-year-old alive because, as we learn, she was his mentor and he genuinely cares about her. We also learn that even though he could have any woman in the Capitol, he loves an emotionally broken woman named Annie from his home district. This last detail implies that Finnick, like Katniss, is more interested in protecting people that are vulnerable than using them, as his public persona would suggest. In fact, that persona seems to be a calculated façade, which suggests that Finnick is highly intelligent.
