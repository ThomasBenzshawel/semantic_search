Woody is a foil to Papa: his attitudes and personal qualities
				contrast with and thereby accentuate Papa’s. Woody, for example,
				is always sure of his identity as an American and his responsibility
				to his family, unlike Papa, who has a complicated identity and who
				does not always act in the best interest of his family. Wakatsuki
				uses the frequent arguments between Woody and Papa to highlight
				the differences between the two men. Their discussion about the
				idea of Woody fighting in the war on the U.S. side exemplifies these
				differences. While Papa believes that fighting for the United States
				would mean fighting for a country that imprisoned him, Woody believes that
				it is his duty as a U.S. citizen to fight for his country. Having
				citizenship allows Woody access to jobs, licenses, and other opportunities
				that are closed to Papa, and he feels that service to his country is
				the price he must pay for the freedom he enjoys. Papa’s experiences
				during and after the war, on the other hand, disillusion him about
				his place in America.
