Modeled after Satan in Milton’s Paradise Lost,
				Lord Asriel is the gentlemanly devil who plans to overthrow God
				and establish a Republic of Heaven. In other stories, Asriel would
				almost certainly be the villain. In Pullman’s trilogy, Asriel is
				complicated, arrogant, and unlikable, but in many ways he is also
				a heroic figure. 

The name Asriel is derived from Asrael,
				the name of a biblical angel. In the Bible, Asrael’s appearance
				heralds the apocalypse. He is also an angel of death who severs
				human souls from human bodies. Lord Asriel hopes to induce an apocalypse
				of his own by waging war on God, and he separates Roger’s soul (his
				daemon) from his body. 

In Milton’s Paradise Lost, Satan tempts
				Eve with the fruit from the tree of knowledge. In Pullman’s trilogy,
				Lord Asriel’s compelling slides of Dust and the aurora borealis
				convince Lyra to go on her quest for knowledge. Though Lord Asriel
				doesn’t ultimately play the serpent to Lyra’s Eve, he does instill
				in her the thirst for knowledge.
