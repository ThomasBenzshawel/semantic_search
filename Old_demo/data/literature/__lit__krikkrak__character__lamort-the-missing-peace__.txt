Lamort, naïve and uneducated, doesn’t worry too much about her own
				well-being because she has a low sense of self-worth. Her grandmother blames her
				for her mother’s death and is never satisfied with her behavior. Lamort never
				had a mother, and she is desperate for approval—from her grandmother, Raymond,
				Emilie, or anyone else. She tries to please her grandmother by living up to her
				standards of propriety and wishes she could be more experienced and intelligent.
				She looks up to independent women like Emilie and feels important when she can
				help them, so she does so eagerly, even when serious risk is involved. Lamort
				accepts the violent, dangerous state of her world, so courage comes easily to
				her. She thinks nothing of bravely coming up with excuses to protect Emilie from
				Toto, the soldier who stops them when they try to go to the churchyard. Emilie’s
				compliments and dependence on Lamort encourage Lamort to be brave in her
				personal life as well, and their adventure together empowers her to stand up to
				her grandmother.
