Like Michael Henchard, Lucetta Templeman lives recklessly according
				to her passions and suffers for it. Before arriving in Casterbridge,
				Lucetta becomes involved in a scandalously indiscreet affair with
				Henchard that makes her the pariah of Jersey. After settling in
				High-Place Hall, Lucetta quickly becomes enamored with Henchard’s
				archrival, Farfrae. Their relationship is peaceful until the town
				learns of Lucetta’s past relationship with Henchard, whereupon they
				make her the subject of a shameful “skimmity-ride.” Although warned
				of these likely consequences, Lucetta proceeds to love whomever
				she wants however she pleases. Still, her character lacks the boldness
				and certainty of purpose that would elevate her to the level of
				“the isolated, damned, and self-destructive individualist” that
				critic Albert Guerard describes as “the great nineteenth-century
				myth.” Lucetta emerges not as heroic but as childish and imprudent.
				Her love for Farfrae, for example, hinges on her refusal to accept
				Henchard’s visits for several days, a refusal that makes her seem
				more petty than resolute. Similarly, her rapidly shifting affections—Farfrae
				eclipses Henchard as the object of her desire with amazing, almost
				ridiculous speed—brand her as an emotionally volatile Victorian
				female, one whose sentiments are strong enough to cause the most
				melodramatic of deaths.
