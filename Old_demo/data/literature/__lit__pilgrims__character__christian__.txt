Christian is the central character of the book and the
				hero of the pilgrimage. Because Bunyan wrote The Pilgrim’s
					Progress as an allegory rather than a novel, Christian
				is not represented as particularly complicated or conflicted and
				has a simple personality. Christian represents just one profound
				aspect of the human experience: the search for religious truth.
				He is his faith (hence his name). Christian’s motivation,
				the search for salvation in the Celestial City, clearly defines
				him.

Christian is deeply goal oriented. Because reaching the
				Celestial City has a life-or-death urgency for him, he has little
				time or energy for lesser matters. Even his family shrinks nearly
				to insignificance in his mind as soon as he leaves for his journey.
				He never mentions his wife or children to his travel companions.
				At the Palace Beautiful, he shows some emotion when one of the four
				mistresses of the house inquires about his family, but he does not
				bring up the subject himself, nor does he return to it later. This
				does not mean Christian lacks feeling but only that the goal of
				salvation far outweighs any earthly concerns a pilgrim has.
