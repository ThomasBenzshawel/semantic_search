Peter van Daan is a few years older than Anne and is the only child in the other family hiding with the Franks in the annex. Anne initially finds Peter obnoxious, lazy, and hypersensitive and is irritated by his hypochondriac tendencies when the van Daans first arrive at the annex. However, over time, Anne and Peter begin to bond. Their attachment is significant for two key reasons. Anne finally finds in Peter the confidant and kindred spirit that she so desperately desired at the start of the diary; she begins to frequent Peter’s loft bedroom where the two of them discuss a number of important topics including their hopes for the future and their Jewish identities. Their dynamic is also significant because it develops from a friendship to a romantic relationship. Peter is Anne’s first kiss and it is because of him that Anne begins to contemplate her own sexuality. In addition to providing a look into the Jewish experience during the Holocaust, The Diary of Anne Frank also catalogs Anne’s journey from a child to a young woman. Anne and Peter’s growing attraction to each other is an important aspect of that journey.
