French science fiction author Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was originally serialized in 1869 and 1870, was published in its entirety in 1871, and was first translated into English in 1873. Widely considered one of the world’s first great science fiction adventure novels, it tells the tale of Captain Nemo and his incredible submarine, the Nautilus, and the three men held captive there: a learned scientist, his devoted servant, and a brawny harpooner. Mostly told in the first person by Professor Pierre Aronnax, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea has delighted readers for more than 150 years and has inspired many successful film adaptations.
