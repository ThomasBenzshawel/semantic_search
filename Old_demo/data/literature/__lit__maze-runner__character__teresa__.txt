Because she arrives at the Glade in a comatose state, Teresa is first known only for her beauty, as the Gladers take note of her fair skin, dark hair, and blue eyes. However, as the only female Glader, Teresa symbolizes change in the Glade, and the residents distrust her immediately. Her inability to speak prevents Teresa from allowing anyone to know her beyond the strange circumstance of her physical presence in the Glade. Through her telepathic communications with Thomas, Teresa begins to take shape as a not only mysterious but also vital player in the game.   

Though Thomas feels a strong desire to protect Teresa, once she wakes she quickly demonstrates the ability to take care of herself. As an outsider, she’s met with limitations beyond her control, though she doesn’t let the suspicion of the others stop her from doing what she believes is right. In her drive to solve the Maze and escape, acting in ways she feels are in the best interest of the group, Teresa shows her intelligence, bravery, strength, and confidence, even when the others treat her poorly. Teresa’s personal resilience becomes vitally important for the survival of all who eventually choose to trust her.
