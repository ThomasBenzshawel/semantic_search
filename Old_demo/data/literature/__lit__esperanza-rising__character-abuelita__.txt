While Esperanza’s grandmother only appears at the story’s beginning and end, her presence is deeply felt throughout. Abuelita is introduced from Esperanza’s admiring perspective as an archetypal grandmother figure with unique twists in her character. She is both distinguished but capricious, a steady force in the family’s life, and a storyteller weaving historical background and love into her words and crochet handwork.

Abuelita is fearless and clever, quick to share sayings and stories from her own life to pass on some of her courage and wisdom. This wisdom includes advice for Esperanza to not fear starting over. The crocheted blanket Abuelita tells Esperanza to finish for her in California becomes a touchpoint as Esperanza adjusts to her new life, and it is also a project to distract her during her mother’s illness.

The reader first hears from Abuelita much of what Esperanza later tells herself to access her own courage and strength. Esperanza’s perceived need for Abuelita to come to California to help her mother heal from both sickness and depression propels Esperanza’s choice to work in the fields and save her money to make it happen. Once in California, Abuelita continues to pass on her wisdom and gifts to others, serving as the extended family’s matriarch.
