Pa Joad is a good, thoughtful man, and he plans the family’s
				trip to California with great care and consideration. The hardships
				faced by the Joads prove too great for him, however, and although
				he works hard to maintain his role as head of the family, he complains of
				muddled thoughts and finds himself in frequent quandaries. Until the
				very end, Pa exhibits a commitment to protecting his family. His determination
				to erect a dam is a moving testament to his love and singleness
				of purpose. When his efforts begin to fall short, however, Pa despairs.
				In California, his inability to find work forces him to retreat
				helplessly into his own thoughts. As a result, he becomes less and
				less effective in his role as family leader, and Ma points this
				out directly. Upon leaving the Weedpatch camp, she boldly criticizes him
				for losing sight of his responsibility to support the family. By
				the end of the novel, further diminished by the failed attempt to
				prevent the family’s shelter from flooding, he follows Ma as blindly
				and helplessly as a child. Pa’s gradual breakdown serves as a sharp reminder
				that hardship does not always “build character.” Though the challenges
				of the Joads’ journey serve to strengthen Ma, Tom, and even Rose
				of Sharon, they weaken and eventually paralyze Pa.
