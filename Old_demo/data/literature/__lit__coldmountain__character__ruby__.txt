Ruby is both a role model and a friend for Ada. As a strong-willed, practical
				woman with keen insight, Ruby initially serves as a foil for the
				dreamy, intellectual Ada. (A foil is a character that reveals the distinctive
				traits of another character through contrast.) Ruby’s store of knowledge
				about the natural world teaches Ada to look outward from herself,
				and to interact with the surrounding environment. Ruby personifies
				many of the novel’s themes about living close to nature, moving
				at pace with its seasons, and establishing a close relationship
				with the land. However, Ruby’s role grows more substantial as Ada’s
				character matures. As Ada develops into a strong friend and co-worker,
				the women’s friendship becomes increasingly sisterly and profound.
				Just as Ada learns about practical life from Ruby, Ruby in turn
				learns from Ada, listening to the classic literature the older woman
				reads aloud and following her lead when it comes to expressing emotion
				(although emotional honesty does not come easily to Ada either).
				Resolutely levelheaded and self-sufficient, Ruby begins to let go
				of past resentment, particularly towards her father, and reclaims
				her faith in love.

	Ruby’s development within the novel, though not as dramatic
				as Inman’s or Ada’s, is far-reaching and profound. Ruby evolves
				from a girl into a natural mother figure. The novel charts her transition from
				someone who could function successfully outside of society as a
				hermit (she is similar in many ways to the goat-woman) to a woman
				who appreciates having her whole family living and working beside
				her. She is a matriarchal figure who keeps her husband and father
				in check without being too domineering. Ruby becomes the tie that
				binds her family together.
