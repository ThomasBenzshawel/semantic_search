Vera Claythorne is a former governess who is working as
				a “games mistress at a third-class school” when the novel begins.
				She takes a summer job on Indian Island, believing that she has
				been hired to serve as a secretary to a Mrs. Una Owen. Like the
				other characters, Vera has a dark secret. At her last job, she was
				governess to a spoiled little rich boy named Cyril Hamilton. She
				let Cyril drown so that his relative, Hugo, would inherit his money
				and then be rich enough to marry her. An inquest cleared
				her of any wrongdoing, but Hugo, certain that Vera had let Cyril
				die, would have nothing more to do with her. Throughout the novel,
				Vera’s guilty memories of her crime plague her. She often thinks
				of Hugo and feels as if he is watching her.

	In some ways, Vera is one of the most intelligent and
				capable characters in the novel, which explains why she is one of
				the last people left standing. She outwits the resourceful Philip
				Lombard, who thinks she is a murderer, by stealing his gun and then
				summoning up the courage to shoot him when he leaps at her. Despite
				her strength, however, Vera is not emotionally stable. In addition
				to her recurrent bouts of guilt over Cyril’s death, she is strongly
				affected by the almost supernatural nature of the events on the
				island and prone to attacks of nervous hysteria. More than anyone
				else, she fixates on the “Ten Little Indians” poem that lends an
				air of eerie inevitability to the murders. The confluence of these
				factors—her guilt, her tendency toward hysteria, and her fascination
				with the nursery rhyme—enables Wargrave to create a suggestive environment
				complete with a noose and the smell of the sea, which inspires Vera
				to hang herself and fulfill the last line of the poem.
