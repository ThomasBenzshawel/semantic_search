The Round House, Louise Erdrich’s award-winning 2012 novel, focuses on the experiences of the Ojibwe/Chippewa people in North Dakota. This novel takes the form of a mystery as the young protagonist searches to find out who attacked his mother. In an afterword, Erdrich notes that she intends for this book to highlight the tragedy of the common occurrence of rape suffered by Indigenous women and how rarely these assaults are successfully investigated or prosecuted.
