Though Zeena is not as rounded a character as her husband,
				the negative aspects of her personality emerge quite clearly, making
				her seem like the novel’s villain. While she is technically the
				victim of Ethan’s plans to commit adultery, the reader comes to
				sympathize much more with Ethan, because he feels imprisoned in
				his marriage to the sickly and shrewish Zeena.

Wharton’s physical descriptions make Zeena seem old and unfeminine.
				Furthermore, Zeena speaks only in a complaining whine, and all her
				actions seem calculated to be as vindictive as possible. Her illness
				might make some of this crotchety behavior forgivable, but she so
				relishes her role as a sufferer that the reader suspects her of
				hypochondria, or at least of exaggeration. Her only talent is caring
				for the sick, and the only time she displays any vitality or sense
				of purpose is when administering to Ethan and Mattie at the end
				of the novel. One imagines her taking a perverse delight in Ethan
				and Mattie’s suffering, since she knows that they attempted to kill
				themselves to escape her. It is important to note, however, that all
				of Zeena’s faults are relayed from Ethan’s point of view, which, given
				his passion for Mattie, is far from impartial.
