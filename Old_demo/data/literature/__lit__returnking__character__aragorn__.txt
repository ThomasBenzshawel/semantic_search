The title of the third volume, The Return of the
					King, refers to Aragorn, or Strider, and his return to
				claim the throne of Gondor. When the hobbits first encounter Strider
				in The Fellowship of the Ring, he is a cloaked
				and mysterious Ranger of the North, a mercenary who patrols the
				borders of Middle-earth against bandits and evildoers. As the novel
				progresses, we learn that Strider is Aragorn, the heir of Isildur,
				the last and greatest king of Men who led the forces of Middle-earth
				against the armies of Mordor. To the hobbits, Strider appears rugged
				yet strangely stately, an ideal combination for the ruler of the
				great realm of Gondor. As time passes, however, Strider becomes
				quiet and aloof. He increasingly refers to himself as Aragorn, and
				his attention is fixed mainly on the throne he will claim if the
				quest to destroy the Ring succeeds.

In Books V and VI, Aragorn ceases to be a character who
				reveals himself through conversations, personality quirks, or limited knowledge
				of events. Aragorn becomes the opposite of the hobbits, who represent
				the common individual’s perspective and for whom the quest is a
				journey of self-understanding and discovery. Aragorn’s character
				reveals itself in the roles he plays, and particularly in the symbolic
				actions he performs. Aragorn emerges as a Christ figure—one whose
				experiences resemble those of Christ and who performs a sacrifice
				that redeems others. Interestingly, Tolkien’s Christ figure does
				not sacrifice himself for anyone in the novel. Aragorn heals people,
				like Christ in the biblical Gospels, but he suffers no wounds on
				their behalf. Tolkien opens the sacrificial role to all characters, particularly
				the most humble ones, the hobbits. Aragorn represents the eschatology
				of Christ—the belief that Christ will return to establish a kingdom
				on earth for his faithful.
