As a graduate of Harvard Business School and a successful money manager, G. H. is quietly confident, but the emergency leads him to doubt himself. Since his job involves using information to predict trends in the markets, he has come to see himself as somewhat omniscient. With all electronic communications cut off, G. H. finds himself in a state of withdrawal because of his lack of access to information. He longs to see how the blackout has affected the money markets, certain that some investors will have made fortunes out of the disaster. As a Black man, G. H. has decades of experience in defusing the distrust of white people, which he uses to reassure Clay and Amanda that he is harmless when he shows up at the door late at night. Once allowed back into his own house, his real character begins to emerge, establishing him as a confident leader who uses logical reasoning to make decisions and keep calm. Although he initially dislikes Amanda, sensing her distrust, he comes to enjoy her company because she can provide him with the audience he craves.  

G. H., like Clay, sees himself as a traditional patriarch, someone should protect and provide for his family. Also like Clay, he wants to be a moral person. Unlike Clay, G. H. becomes more comfortable with the uncertainty of their situation, and avoids jumping to conclusions. Despite this, when Clay cedes his patriarchal power to G. H., G. H. feels the urge to hand his own leadership role over to Danny. This is a miscalculation on G. H.’s part because Danny has no sense of responsibility for anybody other than his own family. This disappointment only hardens G. H.’s resolve to do the right thing by Amanda and Clay’s family.
