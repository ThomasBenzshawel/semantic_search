The exposition of Mama’s transformation from genteel lady of a rich household to an iron-willed field worker desperate to survive with her daughter, Esperanza, is both heartbreaking and inspiring, not least to Esperanza herself. Described as tall, elegant, and beautiful, Mama knows that none of those qualities will help her in her new life, but she is still presented with other virtues that do, such as her dignity, humility, and willingness to work and adapt to a considerably harder existence.

While she is shown as consistently kind, patient, and understanding, Mama is also firm with herself and Esperanza, reminding them both to be grateful for what they do have, including a supportive family group. Mama encourages Esperanza to be strong, and she proves to be a transformative role model for her daughter as the months pass. The vivid descriptions of the changes in Mama’s hair, hands, and clothes as they become weathered and coarse create a picture of a woman worn down but unwilling to break—that is, until illness presents her with no choice. Even while sick and succumbing both to disease and depression, Mama is presented as a model of feminine strength and serves as Esperanza’s main inspiration to accept her new role as a young woman and caretaker.
