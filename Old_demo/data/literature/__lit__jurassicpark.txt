Jurassic Park is a novel by Michael Crichton that was first published in 1990. Like most of Crichton’s best-known works, it combines contemporary technical and theoretical scientific findings with a fast-paced thriller plot. Jurassic Park and its immensely successful 1993 film adaptation sparked tremendous surges in interest in dinosaurs and in cloning, as well as a series of film sequels—all of which have continued to this day, now more than three decade removed from the novel’s initial publication.
