Possessing a remorseless bloodlust, Madame Defarge embodies
				the chaos of the French Revolution. The initial chapters of the
				novel find her sitting quietly and knitting in the wine shop. However,
				her apparent passivity belies her relentless thirst for vengeance.
				With her stitches, she secretly knits a register of the names of
				the revolution’s intended victims. As the revolution breaks into
				full force, Madame Defarge reveals her true viciousness. She turns
				on Lucie in particular, and, as violence sweeps Paris, she invades
				Lucie’s physical and psychological space. She effects this invasion
				first by committing the faces of Lucie and her family to memory,
				in order to add them to her mental “register” of those slated to
				die in the revolution. Later, she bursts into the young woman’s
				apartment in an attempt to catch Lucie mourning Darnay’s imminent
				execution.

Dickens notes that Madame Defarge’s hatefulness does not reflect
				any inherent flaw, but rather results from the oppression and personal
				tragedy that she has suffered at the hands of the aristocracy, specifically
				the Evrémondes, to whom Darnay is related by blood, and Lucie by
				marriage. However, the author refrains from justifying Madame Defarge’s
				policy of retributive justice. For just as the aristocracy’s oppression
				has made an oppressor of Madame Defarge herself, so will her oppression,
				in turn, make oppressors of her victims. Madame Defarge’s death
				by a bullet from her own gun—she dies in a scuffle with Miss Pross—symbolizes
				Dickens’s belief that the sort of vengeful attitude embodied by
				Madame Defarge ultimately proves a self-damning one.
