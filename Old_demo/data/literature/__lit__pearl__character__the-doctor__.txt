Though he does not figure largely in the novella’s plot,
				the doctor is an important character in The Pearl because
				he represents the colonial attitudes that oppress Kino’s people.
				The doctor symbolizes and embodies the colonists’ arrogance, greed,
				and condescension toward the natives, whom the colonists do not
				even try to understand. Like the other colonists, the doctor has
				no interest in Kino’s people. He has come only to make money, and
				his greed distorts his human values. As a physician, the doctor
				is duty-bound to act to save human life, but when confronted with
				someone whom he considers beneath him, the doctor feels no such
				duty. His callous refusal to treat Coyotito for the scorpion
				sting because Kino lacks the money to pay him thus demonstrates
				the human cost of political conquest rooted in the desire for financial
				profit. As his interior monologue in Chapter 1 shows,
				the doctor is obsessed with European society, and European cultural
				values grip his mind so deeply that he doesn’t even realize how
				ignorant he is of Kino and Kino’s people.
