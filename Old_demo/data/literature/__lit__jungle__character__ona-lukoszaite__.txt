Like Jurgis, Ona is more a type than an individual, and
				Sinclair constructs her as an appealing feminine contrast to Jurgis’s
				masculinity. Whereas Jurgis is confident and optimistic, Ona is
				fragile and easily frightened, as when she frets over the cost of
				the wedding feast mere moments after marrying Jurgis. Ona is extremely
				young—not even sixteen at the start of the novel—and is presented
				as a delicate, lovely picture of female traits that Sinclair believed
				his readers would find laudable: docility, loyalty, and trust in
				her husband and family. Ona experiences a crisis when Phil Connor
				rapes her, and she takes on a more independent existence when she
				lies to Jurgis about her whereabouts so that he will not guess what
				has happened to her. But generally, throughout the novel, Ona is
				mainly portrayed as a girl for Jurgis to love and a wife to complete
				the family ideal that Sinclair repeatedly exposes to the destructive
				forces of capitalism. Ona’s death occurs in Chapter 19, only
				slightly more than halfway through the novel, and her final months
				are largely a slide into increased fragility and poor health caused
				by her return to work only a week after giving birth to Antanas.
				In this way, Ona’s death is portrayed as another sacrifice that
				Jurgis must make to capitalism, which pulls his family apart before
				he can even fully establish it.
