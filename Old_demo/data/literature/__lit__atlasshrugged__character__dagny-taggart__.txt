Dagny is remarkable in every way: beautiful, talented,
				determined, and highly intelligent. Her independent spirit leads
				her to trust her own judgment over public opinion. Though calmly
				rational, she is also tremendously passionate about her work and
				love. She is enormously successful as a woman in a man’s world.
				Rand presents her this way to demonstrate that rationality and great
				accomplishments are not gender-specific. Dagny’s defining characteristic
				is a supreme self-confidence. She is keenly aware of her own abilities
				and always knows the right thing to do. But her confidence is also
				her flaw. She leaves the strikers and rejoins the real world because
				she feels she can single-handedly save her railroad and by extension
				her world. No one person can do this, and her realization comes
				nearly too late, as she is the last to join the strike. She is also
				flawed in her optimism about people. Until the end, when she learns
				the looters will torture Galt to make him help them, she continues
				to believe they can be made to understand their errors.
