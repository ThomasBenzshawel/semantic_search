Aza drives her mom to school and her mother comments on her anxious behavior. She implies that she is regularly taking her medication instead of sharing her thoughts that taking a pill to be herself is wrong. Mychal approaches Aza in the hallway and she thinks he wants to ask her out. After Aza rejects him, he clarifies that he actually wants her opinion on asking Daisy out. Aza tells him to ask her and goes to class. 

In class, Daisy texts Aza about Mychal and the police report. Aza questions whether it is fair to Davis for them to tell the tip line about the photo of Russell leaving the property, but Daisy assures her they would be holding a crook accountable for his actions. Davis texts Aza while in class and vents to her about people liking him because of what he has and not who he is. Aza asks him if it would make things better or worse if she called the tip line. Davis says it would be worse because he worries about how his brother, Noah, would react. Aza assures him that she will not contact the tip line about what she knows. 

The next day, Daisy waits for Aza at school to tell her that she and Mychal would go on a double date with Aza and Davis. Aza texts Davis about meeting them at Applebee’s on Friday, which he agrees to. After school, Aza goes to Dr. Singh’s office for her appointment. She thinks about how she wants to tell Dr. Singh that she is getting better because that is what should happen with an illness. They discuss how Aza does not feel in control of her thoughts and that maybe she is not her own self. Dr. Singh acknowledges the metaphors that Aza uses to talk about pain and observes that pain can only really be talked about with metaphors. Aza gets distracted by thoughts of C. diff during their time together despite Dr. Singh assurance that she is not dying from it. Dr. Singh reminds her she needs to take her medication every day.
