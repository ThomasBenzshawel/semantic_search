As the Union troops rest, the fighting deeper in the forest
					intensifies until the air is parched with smoke and the battle-roar
					drowns out all other sounds. During a sudden lull in the battle,
					the men hear one of their comrades, Jimmie Rogers, crying out in
					pain. Thinking there is a stream nearby, Wilson offers to go for
					water and Henry accompanies him. They fail to find a stream, but
					reach a place from which they can see a large portion of the battle
					as it unfolds. They see dark masses of blue troops slowly gather
					into formation. They watch as a general nearly tramples a wounded
					man. As the general and his staff pass by, they hear the commanders
					discussing how best to fortify a weak position. The general asks
					one officer which unit he can spare; the officer replies that the
					only regiment he does not need is the 304th—Henry’s
					regiment—because its members “fight like a lot ’a mule drivers.”

Henry and Wilson, who had believed their regiment
					to be unstoppable, are shocked to hear it insulted. They are further
					stunned to hear the general tell the officer that he expects most
					of the 304th to be killed in the coming attack.
					The two friends hurry back to their comrades with the news that
					they are about to charge. As the officers organize the men into
					marching formation, Henry and Wilson consider what they have heard.
					They do not taint the resolve of the other soldiers with their pathetic
					news, but instead keep the secret to themselves. Nevertheless, they
					prepare for the charge with quiet resignation.

The men lumber forward toward a line of enemy soldiers.
					Henry sees men pounded by bullets, splayed and tumbling in grotesque shapes.
					As the men charge, the regiment comes to a halt twice, until the
					lieutenant once again spurs them into motion. The bullets continue
					to fly and Henry notices the regiment’s flag flying before him. He
					begins to follow it as if it were a sacred talisman. Suddenly, the color
					sergeant—the soldier responsible for carrying the flag, is hit and
					falls to his knees. Henry and Wilson pry the flag from his dead fingers
					and continue to charge.

In these chapters, and for the rest of the novel, Crane
					focuses less on thematic exploration and more on the graphic depiction
					of battle. Henry’s character has endured its initial shock and is
					now prepared to complete its development from innocence into experience,
					from vanity into self-assurance, from cowardice into courage. The
					ensuing battle proves the testing ground for Henry’s character and enables
					the realization of this journey.

The descriptions of war in these late chapters are a marvel, becoming
					increasingly violent and strikingly poetic as the book nears its
					conclusion:

The dramatic, repulsive quality of this passage illustrates
					man’s pitiable smallness in the face of overpowering, all-consuming
					war, but simultaneously hints at the heroism that simply facing
					such cataclysmic horror requires.

The novel transfers its attention from the
					psychology of Henry to that of the regiment as a whole. As the men
					fight together and grow experienced in combat, the narrative begins
					to characterize them as a single individual: “The regiment snorted
					and blew. Among some stolid trees it began to falter and hesitate.”
					Henry does remain the central focus of the novel. However, rather
					than analyze his every thought and feeling, Crane emphasizes his
					role in the group of men around him, even though he does not experience
					the same group-consciousness that he felt during his first battle.
					This shift is a moral triumph as it marks a departure from Henry’s
					self-possessed, narcissistic tendencies. As Henry is freed from
					the agonies of considering his every move, so too is the reader.
					As Henry gives himself fully to the battle—displaying a newfound
					dedication to his fellow soldiers and, therefore—one witnesses his
					formerly adolescent character, once so selfishly focused, bloom
					into that of a generous and honorable man.

The underlying idea is that men in dangerous situations
					form close bonds and often act and think as one, a theme Crane explored explicitly
					in his story “The Open Boat.” Here, he explores this idea indirectly
					through Henry’s relationships with Wilson and the lieutenant, and
					by the shift in his sensitivities and priorities. Where he once
					was thin-skinned about his own prowess, he now takes offense at
					insults directed at the regiment as a whole, as when the derisive officer
					labels him and his companions “mule drivers.”

The relevance of noise and silence comes to the foreground
					in these later chapters as the intensity of battle heightens. The
					novel is alive with the sounds of combat, which Crane variously
					describes as “a terrific fracas” and “splintering and blaring.”
					Toward the end of the novel, however, a silence seeps into the atmosphere,
					anticipating the lovely, almost idyllic sense of peace with which
					the novel closes. Wilson transforms from “the loud soldier” into
					a man who shows “a quiet belief in his purpose and his abilities.”
					Henry eventually reaches a similar maturity, no longer craving the
					loud rumors and reassurances of other men. He soon leaves the frantic
					and empty chatter of boyhood behind for a quieter brand of manhood.
