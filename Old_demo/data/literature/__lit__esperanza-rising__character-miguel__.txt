Smart, handsome, and driven, fifteen-year-old Miguel has grown up beside Esperanza. A deeply trusted worker on El Rancho de las Rosas along with his father Alfonso, Miguel occupies a different social class from Esperanza and teasingly calls her his “queen.” This teasing establishes him as a love interest, but Miguel and Esperanza have a nuanced relationship. Miguel is described as a patient, strong young man, eager to learn and adaptable to his circumstances. Over the course of the year, his relationship with Esperanza changes but he remains her friend. Miguel is respectful and protective of Esperanza; however, he is also capable of distancing himself from her stubbornness and spontaneous reactions to what and who she cannot control.

While aspects of Miguel’s characterization and some of Esperanza’s own thoughts about him set him up as a love interest, he also serves as a role model, moving more comfortably between their old life in Mexico and their new life in California. Miguel is a pragmatic dreamer and hard worker who offers a sharp perspective on the immigrant experience. Miguel maintains his dignity and commits to whatever job is presented to him while keeping his focus on a better future.
