The Marches’ charming, fun, and intelligent next-door
				neighbor, Laurie becomes particularly close to Jo but ends up marrying
				Amy. In between the publication of Part One and Part Two, Alcott received
				many letters asking her to marry Jo to Laurie. Perhaps to simultaneously
				please her readers and teach them a lesson, Alcott had Jo get married,
				but not to Laurie.

	Laurie struggles with his grandfather’s expectations
				of him, in a similar manner to the way Jo struggles with becoming
				a lady. Laurie is not manly enough for his grandfather because he
				does not want to enter the business world. Likewise, Jo is not feminine
				enough for her sisters because she swears, soils her gloves, and
				speaks her mind at all times.
