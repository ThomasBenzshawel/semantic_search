Resigned to the blows that fate deals her, Mercédès acts
				as a foil to her onetime fiancé, Dantès. Though she is a good and
				kind woman, her timidness and passivity lead her to betray her beloved
				and marry another man, Mondego. Mercédès remains miserable for the
				rest of her life, despising herself for her weakness and longing
				for Dantès, whom she has never stopped loving. Yet, for all her
				avowed weakness and fear, Mercédès proves herself capable of great
				courage on three occasions: first, when she approaches Dantès to
				beg for her the life of her son, Albert; second, when she reveals
				her husband’s wickedness in order to save Dantès’s life; and third,
				when she abandons her wealth, unwilling to live off a fortune that
				has been tainted by misdeeds. At the end of the novel, Mercédès
				is left with nothing to live for, aside from the hope that Albert
				might somehow improve his own life. She is the character whose suffering
				is the most complete, despite the fact that there are others who
				bear far more guilt.
