Mimi is an artistic, troubled young woman who struggles to connect with others and considers herself the black sheep of her family. When Jess first meets her, Mimi appears to be a shy girl with an alternative fashion sense. Despite her timid appearance, however, Mimi is deeply passionate and struggles to control her strong, sometimes even violent, emotions. As a young girl, she is sent by her family to a Catholic convent school in order to keep her away from men and out of trouble. There, however, she falls deeply in love with a young male teacher who is later forced to leave the school due to pressure from Mimi’s wealthy and powerful parents. This tendency to obsess over men who do not return her feelings follows Mimi throughout her life, often with destructive consequences.
