A diverse cast of Native American characters narrates There There, Tommy Orange’s 2018 debut novel and a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Characters grapple with the complexities of life in a country that has never welcomed them. Both a gripping work of fiction and a major political intervention, There There challenges perceptions about Native people by presenting several individual stories from perspectives that are often uncomfortable and usually overlooked. The stories weave together to demonstrate a multitude of ways the longstanding mistreatment of indigenous people continues to affect countless lives today.
