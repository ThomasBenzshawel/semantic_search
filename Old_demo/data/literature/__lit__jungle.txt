The Jungle is a novel written by American writer and political activist Upton Sinclair, first published in 1906. The narrative unfolds in the meatpacking industry of Chicago and follows the struggles of an immigrant family, the Rudkus family, as they face harsh working conditions, exploitation, and the challenges of assimilating into American society. Sinclair intended the novel to expose the appalling labor and sanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry, and it became a sensation that had a profound impact on public awareness of food safety and workers’ rights.

Set against the backdrop of early 20th-century industrialization and urbanization, The Jungle provides a scathing critique of capitalism, revealing the exploitation of workers and the unsanitary practices in the meatpacking plants. The novel’s vivid and often shocking descriptions of the meat industry led to significant public outrage and contributed to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act in 1906.

Historically, The Jungle played a crucial role in shaping early 20th-century American policy in the food industry. Although Sinclair aimed to highlight the plight of workers, the public’s reaction focused more on the unsanitary conditions in the meat industry.
