The Green Knight is a mysterious, supernatural creature.
				He rides into Arthur’s court on New Year’s Eve almost as if summoned
				by the king’s request to hear a marvelous story. His supernatural
				characteristics, such as his ability to survive decapitation and
				his green complexion, immediately mark him as a foreboding figure.
				The Green Knight contrasts with Arthur’s court in many ways. The
				knight symbolizes the wildness, fertility, and death that characterize
				a primeval world, whereas the court symbolizes an enclave of civilization within
				the wilderness. But, like the court, the Green Knight strongly advocates
				the values of the law and justice. And though his long hair suggests
				an untamed, natural state, his hair is cut into the shape of a courtly
				garment, suggesting that part of his function is to establish a relationship
				between wilderness and civilization, past and present.

	At Gawain’s scheduled beheading, the Green Knight reveals
				that he is also the host with whom Gawain stayed after his journeys through
				the wilderness, and that he is known as Bertilak de Hautdesert.
				As the host, we know Bertilak to be a courteous, jovial man who
				enjoys hunting for sport and playing games. A well-respected and
				middle-aged lord, the host contrasts with the beardless Arthur.
				In fact, his beard is “beaver-hued,” a feature which associates
				the host with the Green Knight. Other clues exist in the text to connect
				the host with the Green Knight. For instance, both the Green Knight
				and the host value the power of verbal contracts. Each makes a covenant
				with Gawain, and the two agreements overlap at the end of the poem.
