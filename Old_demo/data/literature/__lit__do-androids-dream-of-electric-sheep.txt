Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was published in 1968. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world sparsely populated by human and android characters yearning to live better lives and brings up still-relevant themes of empathy and machine intelligence. In Dick’s satirical style are myriad examples of the hypocrisies of human existence, alongside stirring digressions on the nature of chaos and entropy. Adapted into two films many years apart, Blade Runner (1982) and Blade Runner: 2049 (2017), this grim story of a cop and his quarry has captivated the imagination of readers and cinema-goers worldwide.
