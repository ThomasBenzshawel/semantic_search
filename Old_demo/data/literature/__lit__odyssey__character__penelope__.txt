Though she has not seen Odysseus in twenty years, and
despite pressure the suitors place on her to remarry, Penelope never
loses faith in her husband. Her cares make her somewhat flighty
and excitable, however. For this reason, Odysseus, Telemachus, and
Athena often prefer to leave her in the dark about matters rather
than upset her. Athena must distract her, for instance, so that
she does not discover Odysseusâ€™s identity when Eurycleia is washing
him. Athena often comes to her in dreams to reassure or comfort
her, for Penelope would otherwise spend her nights weeping in her
bed.

Though her love for Odysseus is unyielding, she responds
to the suitors with some indecision. She never refuses to remarry
outright. Instead, she puts off her decision and leads them on with
promises that she will choose a new husband as soon as certain things
happen. Her astute delaying tactics reveal her sly and artful side.
The notion of not remarrying until she completes a burial shroud
that she will never complete cleverly buys her time. Similarly,
some commentators claim that her decision to marry whomever wins
the archery contest of Book 21 results from
her awareness that only her husband can win it. Some even claim
that she recognizes her husband before she admits it to him in Book 23.
