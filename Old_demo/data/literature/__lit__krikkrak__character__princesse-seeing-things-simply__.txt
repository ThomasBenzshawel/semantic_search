Princesse is modest, but she has a strong sense of self-confidence. She is
				unfazed by the advances of the drunk watching the cockfights and even humors him
				when he flirts with her. She thinks Catherine paints her because she’s willing
				to be naked and not because she’s particularly beautiful, but this doesn’t
				bother her. Princesse admires Catherine and her sophistication, but she can also
				be childlike and playful. She fears negative attention and won’t drink the rum
				Catherine offers her, but she doesn’t believe in society’s standards of
				propriety. Eventually, however, she feels daring enough to drink a little rum.
				Princesse is fascinated by the world and excited to learn about it. Though
				Princesse’s standard of living is probably not much better than that of the
				protagonists in the other stories, she notices the beauty around her and wants
				to capture it. She is willing to dedicate herself entirely to art, as she shows
				when she “draws” on her undershirt with her own blood. Princesse is ambitious
				and inspired, and Catherine’s painting of her makes her feel special for her
				part in its creation.
