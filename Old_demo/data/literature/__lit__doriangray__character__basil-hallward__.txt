Basil Hallward is a talented, though somewhat conventionally minded,
				painter. His love for Dorian Gray
				changes the way he sees art; indeed, it defines a new school of expression
				for him. Basil’s portrait of Dorian marks a new phase of his career.
				Before he created this masterwork, he spent his time painting Dorian
				in the veils of antiquity—dressed as an ancient soldier or as various
				romantic figures from mythology. Once he has painted Dorian as he
				truly is, however, he fears that he has put too much of himself
				into the work. He worries that his love, which he himself describes
				as “idolatry,” is too apparent, and that it betrays too much of
				himself. Though he later changes his mind to believe that art is
				always more abstract than one thinks and that the painting thus
				betrays nothing except form and color, his emotional investment
				in Dorian remains constant. He seeks to protect Dorian, voicing
				his objection to Lord Henry’s injurious influence over Dorian and
				defending Dorian even after their relationship has clearly dissolved.
				Basil’s commitment to Dorian, which ultimately proves fatal, reveals
				the genuineness of his love for his favorite subject and his concern
				for the safety and salvation of Dorian’s soul.
