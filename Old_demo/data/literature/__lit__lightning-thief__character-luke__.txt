Luke is the son of Hermes. He is slightly older than Percy and his group of friends. Luke serves as the antagonist of the story. Because Luke’s quest is a repeat of the quest given to Hercules, he is very disillusioned. Luke obtains Percy’s trust by pretending to believe in Percy’s potential as he trains him in sword-fighting. Luke serves as a guide to Percy as he adjusts to camp life and gifts Percy with magical shoes before Percy embarks on his quest, further encouraging Percy to believe he has made a true ally and friend. Luke betrays Percy and the gods because he himself feels betrayed. Luke’s anger is prompted by how he feels abandoned by the gods, and this prompts him to use the same manipulation tactics that the gods use. He feels that his superiors underestimate his potential and that his talents are being wasted at the camp, so he takes control back the only way he knows how: by serving Kronos.
