The Age of Innocence, published in 1920 by American author Edith Wharton, is a novel that explores the themes of love, desire, and societal expectations. The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is set in New York City during the 1870s and follows the life of Newland Archer, a young lawyer who is engaged to marry the beautiful and conventional May Welland. However, when Mayâ€™s cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, returns to New York after a failed marriage, Newland finds himself drawn to her and forced to confront the rigid social codes of his time. The Age of Innocence was adapted into a well-regarded film by Martin Scorese starring Daniel-Day Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder in 1993.
