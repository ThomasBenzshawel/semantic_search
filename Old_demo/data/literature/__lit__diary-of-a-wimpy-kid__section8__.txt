Rowley begins ignoring Greg and gets a new best friend, Collin Lee. When Rowley has a sleepover with Collin, Greg retaliates by going to Fregley’s house for a sleepover. When Fregley eats a bag of jelly beans and becomes manic, Greg locks himself in the bathroom until Fregley passes a note under the door with a booger on it. Greg blacks out, wakes up at 2:00 a.m., and goes home. Soon after, Greg sees Rodrick’s middle school yearbook and decides that he wants to be named one of the Class Favorites. He thinks he will try to be Class Clown and starts to make a plan.
