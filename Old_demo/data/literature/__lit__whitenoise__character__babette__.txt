Babette, Jack’s fourth wife, is described as the quintessential
				loving mother and spouse. Slightly overweight, with a head full
				of messy blond hair, Babette bakes cookies for the children, tells
				her husband everything, and, in her free time, reads tabloids to
				the blind and teaches a course on posture to the elderly. In her
				apparent honesty and sincerity, Babette contrasts with Jack’s previous
				wives, who were closed off and secretive. Jack takes great comfort
				from Babette and the openness that characterizes their marriage.
				Babette, however, has secretly been taking an experimental drug
				called Dylar. When first Denise and then Jack confront her about
				the pills, Babette completely denies any knowledge of it. Only after
				Jack finds a pill and has it analyzed does Babette confess that
				she has been sleeping with a doctor in exchange for Dylar, in the
				hopes that the drug would relieve her own overwhelming fear of death.
				The shift in Babette’s personality, from open and loving to evasive
				and cynical, reflects the novel’s pervasive concern with the fluctuating
				and unstable nature of identity.
