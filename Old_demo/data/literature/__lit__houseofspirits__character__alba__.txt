Alba is defined primarily through the affects she has
				on those around her and through her reactions to their actions.
				It is in fact in reaction to her detention, torture, and rape at
				the hands of Esteban Garcia that she convinces her grandfather to
				help her write the story of their family in order to, as she puts
				it, "reclaim the past and overcome terrors of my own."
