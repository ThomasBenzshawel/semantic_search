In it, Coriolanus Snow, a young man on the brink of ruin, is eager to change his fate and redeem his family’s honor as a mentor in the tenth year of the Hunger Games. His ambitions clash with his loyalties as he grows closer to Lucy Gray Baird, the girl he’s sending to almost certain death, and the novel uses their relationship to explore chilling social divisions, the heavy tolls of physical and emotional violence, and the inevitable price of power. The book has sold over 3.5 million copies and was adapted into a movie in the fall of 2023.
