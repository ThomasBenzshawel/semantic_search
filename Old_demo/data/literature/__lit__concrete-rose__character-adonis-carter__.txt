Adonis is Mav’s father, who has been in prison since Mav was eight. It pains Adonis to be away from his family, and he attempts to be the best father he can be despite his guilt about being in prison. He is an original member of the King Lords, but never pressures Mav to believe that he is obligated to follow in his father’s footsteps. When Adonis names his son Maverick, it is with the hope that he will live up to his name and think for himself.

Thinking for himself is precisely what Adonis allows Mav to do when he counsels his son about killing Red. He understands that Mav is concerned about the gang code, but Adonis loves his son more than he loves his former gang. He knows that Mav faces many tough decisions and Adonis does not pretend to have made all the right ones himself.
