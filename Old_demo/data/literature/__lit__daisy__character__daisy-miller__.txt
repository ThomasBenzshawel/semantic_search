Daisy Miller is a wealthy, young, American girl from upstate
				New York, traveling around Europe with her mother and younger brother.
				Daisy is a curious mixture of traits. She is spirited, independent,
				and well meaning, but she is also shallow, ignorant, and provincial—almost
				laughably so. She offers the opinion that Europe is “perfectly sweet,”
				talks with shameless monotony about the tiresome details of her
				family’s habits and idiosyncrasies, thinks Winterbourne might know
				an Englishwoman she met on the train because they both live in Europe,
				and wonders if Winterbourne has heard of a little place called New
				York. Daisy is also a tiresome flirt. She has no social graces or
				conversational gifts, such as charm, wit, and a talent for repartee,
				and she is really interested only in manipulating men and making
				herself the center of attention.

Throughout Daisy Miller, Winterbourne
				obsesses over the question of whether Daisy is a “nice” girl, and Daisy’s
				behavior never reveals whether she is or isn’t. Winterbourne accepts
				that Daisy is vulgar but wonders whether she is innocent, and we
				never really find out the truth. Daisy does often seem less than
				innocent—Winterbourne does, after all, catch her with Mr. Giovanelli
				late at night at the Coliseum. However, whether such actions are
				or are not appropriate is more a matter of social convention than
				any firm moral expectation. In the end, the truth we find out about
				Daisy is only what Winterbourne thinks is true.
