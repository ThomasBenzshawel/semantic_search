Toor Pekai stands as an example of what Malala’s life might be like if she gives up her education. Although Toor Pekai excels at school as a young child, she decides to stop attending classes because that is the norm for girls. In a sad commentary on her culture, she recognizes, even as a young girl, that she will never work outside the home so it is impractical to continue her education despite her intelligence. Although she chose domestic life, Toor Pekai consistently encourages Malala’s pursuit of education, and her own lack of education makes her self-conscious as an adult.

Although not as outspoken as her husband, Toor Pekai sets a quiet and strong example for her daughter at home by honoring her Pashtun heritage through her kindness and strength while simultaneously bypassing norms that do not align with her beliefs. For example, Toor Pekai often opens her home to needy people in her community, but she also goes out shopping without a male companion. Toor Pekai also sets a unique example as a wife. Typically, marriages are arranged in Pakistan, but Ziauddin and Toor Pekai choose each other. The two share everything and live as equals. Ziauddin not only asks Toor Pekai for advice, but he also follows it showing that he respects her wisdom. When the family reunites in their new home in England, Toor Pekai struggles most with the loss of her homeland because she is the family member most connected to the old ways. However, she is content with the trade-off and never complains because Malala is safe. Toor Pekai embodies the best aspects of Pashtun culture but also possesses the progressive views that allow Malala to break old patterns and reach her full potential.
