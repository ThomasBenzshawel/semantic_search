Paul, an extremely well-educated Jew, is living in Palestine
				when he receives a vision of Jesus and becomes a follower. Paul,
				however, continues to call himself the “Jew of Jews.” Christianity
				is indebted to Paul’s tireless toil for the Gospel in the first
				century, and to his robust intellectual prowess, which brings Christianity
				from a small handful of fringe-society disciples to a church with
				a sophisticated theology treating such complex issues as the relationship
				between faith and works, and the balance between unity and diversity.
				It is clear that Paul, whom some have called “history’s first egalitarian,” develops
				an enormous range of church leaders, including many women, in his
				household churches that peppered the hillsides of the Roman Empire
				and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
