Bob takes the reader out of the realm of adulthood. Looking at Shane and life through his eyes allows a different perspective; it is one of awe and reverence and one tempered by the boyishness of the Old West. Bob fancies guns and pretends to shoot Indians. He is a good boy, but his character is by no means developed. The impact Shane has on him is observable throughout and is probably greater than Shane's impact on any one other person. Before Shane came along, Bob used to admire Fletcher and his men. After meeting Shane, Bob has a completely new definition of what it means to be a real hero and finally has a real role model to fill that spot. Bob learns that being a man is not about toting guns or asserting dominance over others. He learns that being a man is about doing the right thing, and he looks to Shane time and time again for demonstration. Shane also affirms Bob's opinion about his father. Bob sees Shane's deep respect and loyalty to Joe, and Bob knows that his father is not like Fletcher's men, but is more like Shaneâ€”respectable and a true hero.
