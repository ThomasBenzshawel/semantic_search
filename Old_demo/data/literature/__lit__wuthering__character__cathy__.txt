The daughter of Edgar Lindon and Catherine, Cathy (as she's referred to in this SparkNote for clarity's sake) serves as a beacon of hope and change, and represents the act of breaking through patterns of generational trauma. The reader is first introduced to her while she is being held prisoner, trapped in Heathcliff’s clutches, rendering Cathy’s arc across the book transformative; she goes from serving as a pawn to becoming independent. In a book where nearly every character meets a tragic end, Cathy doesn’t merely offer a sign of hope for what’s to come, but also stands strong as a force of nature that can persevere. As all the characters around her succumb to their own weaknesses or cave to the power of societal demands, Cathy emerges a stronger and more independent figure whose will, imagination, and childhood sense of wonder allow her to withstand the cruel elements around her.

When Cathy’s bold and eager personality crumbles into darkness and depression under Heathcliff's control, she reaches a crossroads that parallels one faced by many of the other characters as well, with her mother as the most direct example. Yet where so many before Cathy have failed, she ultimately maintains her humanity and is willing to find beauty in unexpected places when she opens up to Hareton, and ultimately falls in love with him. Helping him learn to read and write, for example, illustrates the transformative effect she has on a manor, one which contrasts with the decay and stagnation for which it has been previously known.

After Heathcliff’s death, Cathy is truly free. She and Hareton are able to move forward in their lives, something the previous generations never achieved. Untethered by the machinations and agendas of their families, they are able to look toward the future, to build a life of joy together that their parents never knew.
