Supposedly 200 years old, the alchemist is a mysterious character and an
				extremely powerful practitioner of alchemy who resides at the Al-Fayoum oasis. Many
				in Al-Fayoum do not know of his existence, and even the tribal chieftains must
				request an audience if they wish to see him. He has among his possessions the Master
				Work, considered the ultimate goal of alchemy, which consists of the Philosopher’s
				Stone, capable of turning any metal into gold, and the Elixir of Life, able to cure
				all ills. In addition, he appears to possess magical powers. The alchemist mainly
				functions as a teacher to Santiago, though he often speaks in riddles and expects
				Santiago to learn more through experience than through verbal
				instruction.

The alchemist’s teachings connect the book’s dominant metaphor of
				alchemy—transforming one element into another more valuable element—to Santiago’s
				own journey. The alchemist’s wisdom connects him to the mystical Soul of the World.
				This connection provides him with his supernatural abilities, and it allows him to
				guide Santiago on his own quest to understand the Soul of the World. Santiago, with
				the alchemist’s guidance, learns to read and communicate with the world around him,
				ultimately leading him to the treasure he seeks and to his own supernatural
				abilities. In other words, Santiago eventually undergoes his own transformation. The
				alchemist’s hands-off method of teaching, however, suggests that no direct form of
				instruction can allow someone to connect with the Soul of the World. Instead,
				Santiago, and in fact any student, must teach and transform himself by listening to
				his own heart and to his environment.
