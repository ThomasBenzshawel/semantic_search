Extinction Rebellion Rally. Marble Arch, London, April 23, 2019

Thunberg has a simple message for those at the rally: humanity is facing an existential crisis that has never been treated as a crisis before. For too long, “the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis. But we will make sure that they do not get away with it any longer.” The people in Extinction Rebellion, and the children on strike from school to protest lack of action on climate change, together are making a difference.

When speaking to those she regards as allies, Thunberg maintains her direct style but changes her argumentative strategies. Unlike the powerful politicians she often addresses, this audience is already aware of the seriousness of the climate crisis and is eager to help. Thunberg creates solidarity with them and assures them of the value and importance of their mutual effort. For example, when Thunberg tells her audience that “we” will prevent irresponsible officials from failing her generation, she positions herself and her listeners as members of the same side, united against a common enemy. Her language is plain, with none of the vivid visuals and figures of speech that she sometimes uses. Thunberg delivers her message simply and with confidence that it will be heard and understood.
