					Margaret and Henry decide to build a new home
					in Sussex.  One day, as Margaret looks over the
					plans, Dolly appears with a strange bit of news:
					Miss Avery has begun unpacking all of the
					Schlegels' luggage, and arranging their furniture and
					possessions at Howards End.  Charles, Dolly
					inadvertently lets slip, suspects Margaret of
					ordering her to do so as part of a covert plan to
					take over Howards End.  Margaret insists that she has
					done no such thing, and travels to Howards End to set
					Miss Avery straight.  Here, the peculiar old woman
					insists prophetically that Margaret will soon be
					living at Howards End; she says that the house has
					been empty long enough, and that Mrs. Wilcox
					would like to see the Schlegels' furniture there.
				


					Aunt Juley becomes ill with pneumonia, and
					Margaret and Tibby rush down to Swanage to be with
					her on what seems to be her deathbed.  Helen, to
					Margaret's chagrin, has been lived abroad for many
					months, and her correspondence seems troublingly
					distant.  She returns to England only reluctantly,
					and when Aunt Juley recovers, she declines to leave London.
					She only sends a note asking Margaret where her books
					are, saying that she intends to return to Bavaria at once
					and would like to bring a few of her things with her.  On
					Tibby's advice, Margaret consults Henry about Helen's
					strange behavior; his practical mind can only suggest that
					she is exhibiting signs of mental illness, and he
					orchestrates a scheme to surprise her with a doctor
					at Howards End.  On his orders, Margaret writes Helen
					a letter telling her when she can retrieve her books
					from Howards End; then she and Henry prepare to
					surprise her there.
				


					At Hilton, Henry attempts to leave Margaret at
					Charles' house and go to Howards End alone, but
					Margaret leaps into the car just as he drives off.
					They stop to pick up a doctor, Margaret feeling
					increasingly reluctant about the entire plan.  At
					Howards End, they find Helen on the porch.   Margaret
					sees immediately what has prompted Helen's strange
					behavior: She is pregnant.  She hurries Helen into
					the house, and with difficulty persuades Henry and
					the doctor to leave so that she can talk to Helen
					alone.  Feeling as though she is fighting for women
					against men, Margaret ushers them away, then goes
					into the house to talk to her sister.
				


					This section of the novel is largely transitional, and
					serves chiefly to move most of the important characters
					(Leonard is the exception) into position for the
					final conflict of the novel.  Forster builds suspense
					before the revelation of Helen's pregnancy by
					leading the reader to suspect that she is mad, or at
					least severely mentally unbalanced.  Interestingly,
					the only clue we have that Helen has had a traumatic
					sexual episode with Leonard is her tearfulness
					when she visits Tibby the next day, and that clue
					also effectively plays into the idea that she is
					really mad.  When Forster shows Margaret
					betraying her own principles to try to help Helen by
					going to Henry for advice, he sets the stage for
					a crisis situation.  When Margaret discovers Helen's
					actual condition, the crisis is replaced by a moment
					of acute surprise, for the reader can hardly have
					suspected the truth.
				


					At this point, any symbolic or thematic importance
					ascribed to Helen's pregnancy itself is postponed;
					what is important in these chapters is how Margaret
					reacts to it.  Margaret's first concern is for her
					beloved sister, and she dismisses Henry and the
					doctor with an argument that the most important thing
					now is simply love.  She says that she loves Helen
					more than they do, and therefore she is the only
					person who can help her.  This kind of argument is
					utterly alien to Henry's rather thoughtless,
					emotionally repressed character, but Margaret fights
					the battle as though she were fighting for all women.
					Forster implies that the unjust sexual dynamic
					Margaret is forced to endure on a daily basis as a
					result of her marriageÂ—a dynamic which Margaret understands,
					and endures willingly--has taken more of a toll on
					her than she had expected.  Now, she associates a
					forceful restatement of her basic philosophy of
					life--that human relations are more important than
					anything else--with a forceful restatement of her
					independent identity as a woman.
				


					Forster's critique of gender relations in Howards
						End is an extremely nuanced and subtle one, and
					the novel does not simply vilify men and glorify
					feminism; rather, it simply portrays as accurately as
					possible the way the individual characters really
					feel about their positions, admitting that one of
					Margaret's reasons for marrying Henry is that she is
					gratified to be loved by "a real man."  But in this
					chapter, Margaret is simply sick of being bustled
					about and controlled by men.  In the next section of
					the novel, her impatience with Henry's chauvinism
					will boil over into fury.
