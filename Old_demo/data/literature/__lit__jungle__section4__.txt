[A] population . . . dependent for its
						opportunities . . . upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous
						as the old-time slave drivers.

Jurgis demands that the agent who sold his family the
					house reveal all of its hidden expenses. The agent explains that
					they must pay seven dollars a year for insurance, ten dollars a
					year in taxes, and six dollars a year for water. He adds that if
					the city chooses to install a sewer and a sidewalk, they would have
					to pay between thirty-seven and forty-seven dollars.

Spring arrives and with it come frequent cold rains and
					mud. In the summer, the factories are infernos. Moreover, legions
					of flies descend on Packingtown, attracted by the blood and meat.
					Marija regains her job at the can painting factory, only to lose
					it two months later. She is fired when she vocally protests being
					cheated out of a portion of her wages. The loss of her income is
					devastating to the family because Ona is now expecting Jurgis’s
					child. It takes Marija a month to find work as a beef trimmer. The
					boss hires her because she is as strong as a man while her wages
					are half of a man’s.

Ona’s supervisor, Miss Henderson, the superintendent’s
					jilted mistress, runs a brothel. Her prostitutes get jobs easily
					in Ona’s department. She hates Ona because she is a decent married
					woman and her toadies make Ona miserable.

Ona gives birth to a healthy boy. She and Jurgis name
					him Antanas after Jurgis’s father. Jurgis is seized with an overpowering
					affection for his child and his commitment to his role as a family
					man grows in consequence. But his long work hours prevent him from seeing
					his son very much. Ona returns to work a week after giving birth,
					and her health suffers badly.

The Packingtown laborers are worked at an ever greater
					speed only to see their wages cut numerous times. Marija opens a
					bank account for her savings. One morning she discovers that there
					is a run on the bank. She waits for two days in the line before
					she can withdraw her money. In truth, her fear is unfounded: an
					attempt by a policeman to arrest a drunk at the saloon next to the
					bank drew a crowd, and people who saw the crowd believed that there
					was a run on the bank, so they hurried to withdraw their money.
					Marija sews her savings into her clothing, which now weighs her
					down so that she fears sinking into the mud in the street.

Jurgis sprains his ankle and cannot return to
					work for almost three months. The frustration eats away at him and
					he often vents his bitterness upon his family. His infant son is
					often the only way for him to return to good humor. Stanislovas
					suffers frostbite in his hands, and the first joints on his fingers
					are permanently damaged. Jurgis often has to beat Stanislovas in
					order to make him go to work on snowy mornings.

Jonas disappears, so the family sends Nikalojus
					and Vilimas, Teta Elzbieta’s ten- and eleven-year-old sons, respectively,
					to work as newspaper sellers. After a few mishaps, the boys learn
					the tricks of the trade.

Teta Elzbieta’s youngest child, Kristoforas, dies after
					eating bad meat. While the old woman is stricken with grief, the
					rest of the family is relieved, as Kristoforas was congenitally
					crippled and fussed continually, wearing the nerves of everyone
					but Teta Elzbieta. Marija loans Teta Elzbieta the money to pay for
					a real funeral because Jurgis refuses to help.

In the spring, Jurgis looks unsuccessfully for work. He
					is worn out and unable to attract the boss’s eye. He settles for
					the least desirable job around, a position in a fertilizer mill.
					The chemicals seep into his skin, making him smell as foul as the
					muck itself.

The summer brings greater prosperity to the family. Vilimas
					and Nikalojus, however, begin to acquire bad habits on the streets,
					so the family sends them back to school. Teta Elzbieta takes a job
					in a sausage factory. Her thirteen-year-old daughter, Kotrina, takes
					care of Antanas and her other crippled brother, Juozapas. The bad
					working conditions wear on Teta Elzbieta’s health—she must stand
					and perform the same repetitive motion for hours on end.

In Packingtown, not even the arrival of spring brings
					cheer to the worker’s life. Every season brings with it cause for
					suffering, which is as relentless as time itself in the wage laborer’s
					world. These chapters illustrate the precarious existence of wage
					laborers—they are always on the verge of a financial crisis. The
					injury that incapacitates Jurgis is enough to upset the entire household’s
					stability, forcing others to assume the burden of earning income.
					The world that Sinclair portrays is remarkably Darwinian, as Jurgis
					and his family are running a losing race for survival. The conditions
					of life for them are so harsh that mere survival is considered a
					success. The weak, the crippled, and the old are weeded out with
					brutal efficiency.

Capitalists such as those who ran the Chicago stockyards
					in the early twentieth century often justified brutal labor practices
					with a philosophy known as Social Darwinism. This philosophy adapts Darwin’s
					theory of evolution to economic struggle, implying that, as in nature,
					only the fittest and the strongest are meant to survive. According
					to Social Darwinism, wealthy capitalists were considered the fittest
					of the human race because they were so successful. The wage laboring
					class was considered an inferior form of humanity. The widespread
					racism and prejudice against immigrants helped this belief gain
					power and influence in turn-of-the-century American culture. By
					attributing Jurgis with a strong physique and an initially enthusiastic
					attitude, Sinclair tries to demonstrate the fiction of Social Darwinism.
					Capitalism ruins strong, healthy individuals as well as the crippled,
					the weak, and the old. Only those who are morally corrupt, it seems,
					survive.

Marija’s fear about being weighed down into the mud by
					her money is a metaphor for the evils of capitalism. Sinclair argues
					that this system of greed oppresses individuals; here, Marija’s
					coins are a concretized form of money that physically oppresses
					her. The unassailable primacy of money has conditioned her to guard
					her money with her life. Marija’s quasi-religious devotion to her
					coins seems to recall Jesus’ admonition, according to the New Testament
					that “[i]t is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
					than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God” (Matthew 19:24).
					Though she clutches the money not because she is greedy but because
					she needs it to survive, Marija has been distorted by capitalism
					into an un-Christian figure, descending into the mud of base desire.

Throughout these chapters, Sinclair accuses capitalism
					of undermining the family. Ona has to return to work a mere week
					after giving birth. She doesn’t have the opportunity to be a mother
					to her child. Almost everyone is happy when the crippled Kristoforas
					dies because, from a reasoning, mathematical point of view—which
					is indeed the lens through which these immigrants must examine their lives—the
					child is a drain on the family’s resources, a consumer without being
					a producer. Jurgis’s long work hours prevent the development of
					a strong bond with his son. The desperate need for sustenance takes
					priority over sympathy and love, as evidenced by Jurgis’s beating
					of the frostbitten Stanislovas. Jurgis and his family’s poverty,
					a result of capitalist economics, prevent them from being together
					as a family. Jonas even disappears without warning; it is possible
					that he dies while at work, but it is more likely that he simply
					abandons the family, which has deteriorated into a collection of individuals
					struggling to eke out an existence. Within the capitalist system,
					families are a burden best avoided if a single individual wishes
					to survive.
