Hermione Granger is a quintessential brain, in the same way that while Harry represents courage and Ron represents loyalty. Hermione was born to a Muggle family, but she is the top student in her class. These traits make one of Malfoy's favorite targets. She pleases her teachers and follows rules. She values grades and genuinely loves to learn. Although she disapproves of Ron and Harry's sometimes questionable behavior, she stands by them. Hermione is good- natured and adventurous, and always helpful and brilliant. When in doubt, she turns to books, and usually she knows how to find an answer. Hermione's research and training is essential in helping Harry prepare for and triumph in his three Triwizard tasks.

Although her priorities lean heavily toward obsessive academic details, she is very self-confident and forthright, pursuing without abandon the causes in which she believes, such as the liberation of house-elves. In this book, she seems to have matured significantly, becoming a more loyal friend than ever before, especially when Ron and Harry aren't speaking after the Goblet of Fire chose Harry as a champion. She becomes a subject of much contention when Viktor Krum develops a crush on her, causing tension between her and Ron, who also seems to have a crush on her. She handles it in a rather immature and belligerent manner. She is extremely clever and fair, and she provides a great deal of support to Harry in this book.
