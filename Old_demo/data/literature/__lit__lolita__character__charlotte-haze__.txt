A typical middle-class, middle-aged American woman, Charlotte Haze
				aspires to sophistication and European elegance, but her attempts
				fall comically flat. She is religious and not particularly imaginative.
				Charlotte sees Humbert as the epitome of the world-weary European
				lover of—and in—grand literature. He represents her chance to become
				the woman she dreams of being, but her vulgar, self-conscious stabs
				at sophistication, such as her tendency to drop celebrity names
				and mispronounce French phrases, make Humbert cringe. Humbert usually
				refers to her derisively as Mama or the Haze woman. Charlotte’s
				love letter to Humbert traffics mainly in self-pitying martyrdom
				and melodramatic gestures. Nabokov portrays Charlotte with so little
				sympathy that the tragic elements of her character almost disappear.
				She dies, after all, knowing that the man she loves lusts after
				her own daughter.

Charlotte is not particularly fond of Lolita. Although
				Lolita’s adolescent tantrums certainly don’t make her a very likeable
				child, Charlotte’s distain signals a greater lack of motherly concern
				than normal. Charlotte seems to see Lolita as a threat, almost as
				competition, and she sends Lolita to camp to keep her from hindering
				her romantic plans for Humbert. Humbert, of course, sees Charlotte only
				as an obstacle to his romantic plans for Lolita. Though Charlotte
				is not an overtly kind and wonderful mother, her presence does protect
				Lolita—when Charlotte dies, Humbert is free to kidnap Lolita and
				change her life forever.
