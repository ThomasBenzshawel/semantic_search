Thomas comes from a humble background—his mother was a cook and his father was a janitor. With Metias’s help, Thomas rises above his station to join the prestigious military ranks. Thomas earns his place through a strong sense of discipline and a high score on the Trial. Even June, a highly-accomplished person herself, admires Thomas’s discipline. However, Thomas lacks a conscience. When Commander Jameson orders him to massacre a crowd of protesters and later to shoot Day’s mother in the head, he carries out the orders without any sense of regret. June feels uncomfortable around Thomas for this reason. She feels as if he carries out orders to kill like any other orders and can’t understand how he can carry them out so blindly. 

Because Thomas was able to rise through the ranks through sheer effort, he thinks anyone can. He calls Day and his friends dirty and lazy for not working their way up, too. Thomas doesn’t change—his lack of conscience and morals remains the same and never wavers, even when he is told to kill Metias. Thomas and his values are completely aligned with the Republic and its mission. Unlike Day or June, he doesn’t question the Republic and doesn’t consider it important to think for himself.
