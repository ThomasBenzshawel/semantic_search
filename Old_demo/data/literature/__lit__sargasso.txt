Wide Sargasso Sea by British author Jean Rhys, published in 1966, is a compelling and complex novel that is meant to serve as a prequel to Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre. Set in Jamaica during the post-emancipation 1840s, the novel explores the life of Antoinette Cosway, a Creole woman who, in Rhys’s imagining, becomes the madwoman in the attic in Brontë's classic. The narrative delves into Antoinette’s early years, her troubled marriage to Mr. Rochester, and the psychological unraveling that leads to her confinement.

Historical context is crucial to understanding Wide Sargasso Sea. The novel unfolds against the backdrop of social and racial tensions in Jamaica after the abolition of slavery. It also addresses issues of identity, displacement, and the consequences of colonialism. Rhys provides a powerful exploration of the racial and cultural conflicts that contribute to Antoinette's tragic fate. Wide Sargasso Sea remains relevant for its exploration of post-colonial and feminist themes. The novel has become a seminal work in postcolonial literature, shedding light on the silenced stories of those affected by the legacies of colonialism.

Adaptations of Wide Sargasso Sea include a 1993 film directed by John Duigan. This adaptation brings Rhys's powerful and haunting narrative to the screen, further extending the impact of the novel.
