Poe explores the imagery of doubles in “William Wilson.”
				William Wilson loses his personal identity when he discovers a classmate who
				shares not only his full name but also his physical appearance and
				manner of speaking. Poe stresses the external aspects of their similarity
				less than the narrator’s mental turmoil, which is triggered by his
				encounter with his rivalrous double. When the narrator attempts
				to murder his double in the story’s final moments, he ironically
				causes his own death. This action demonstrates the bond of dependence
				between the hated double and the loved self. The -murder-suicide
				confirms the double as the narrator’s alter ego. In other words,
				the narrator’s double exists not as an external character but rather
				as part of the narrator’s imagination. Poe uses the idea of the
				double to question the narrator’s grasp on reality. The -murder-suicide
				implies that the narrator has imagined the existence of his rival
				because he suffers from paranoia, a mental state in which the human
				mind suspects itself to be threatened by external forces that are
				just imaginary figments of irs own creation.
