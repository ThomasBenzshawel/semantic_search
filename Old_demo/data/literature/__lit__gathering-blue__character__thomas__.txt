As Kira’s foil, Thomas shows how Kira’s disability and upbringing have shaped her into someone especially well-equipped to point the village in the direction of change for the better. While Thomas and Kira are both artists tasked with filling in the future on their respective objects, Thomas is unable to look past the literal work of carving, while Kira can see that weaving the future holds meaning beyond the physical threads in her fingers. Thomas has lived in the Edifice for most of his life, but Kira has grown up around the other villagers while also being set apart from them. When Thomas lived outside the Edifice, he was a typical tyke apart from his skill with carving, so he didn’t need to develop the depth of perspective that Kira’s innate differences forced on her. In this way, Gathering Blue shows that creativity and artistic talent alone are not enough to grant someone the critical thinking ability necessary to change society for the better. In contrast to the sheltered life that Thomas has lived, Kira’s broad range of experiences, both negative and positive, have made her capable of catalyzing change.
