Sophie is a poised and elegant middle-aged woman, who seemingly lives the typical life of a wealthy Parisian housewife. She wears expensive clothing, closely maintains her slim figure through a highly restrictive diet, and entertains her husband’s guests in their lavish apartment. Behind the perfect facade, however, Sophie feels like an animal trapped in a cage. She spends most of her time at home while her husband works and (she suspects) conducts affairs, an arrangement which brings her little personal or romantic satisfaction. By the time that Ben moves into the building, Sophie’s inner turmoil has reached boiling point, leading her to act with uncharacteristic recklessness.
