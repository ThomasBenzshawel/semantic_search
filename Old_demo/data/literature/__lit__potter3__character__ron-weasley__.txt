Ron possesses the confidence of being a child deeply loved. Unlike Harry, he has no financial means. His father is a highly ranked member of the Ministry of Magic and his family is backed by generations of pure wizard blood, but Ron is often picked on by Malfoy for wearing tattered robes, for living in an old house, and for not having a rich father. Ron is deeply loyal to the people he loves—his family, Harry, his pet rat Scabbers, and Hermione—and he defends their rights with a fiery desperation, as we see in this book when he refuses to speak to Hermione for allowing her cat to attack his rat, or for turning Harry's new broomstick into Professor McGonagall. He and Harry are inseparable, and he is often perceived to be a sidekick to the famous Harry Potter. Ron feels valued by Harry and doesn't seem to mind this on a regular basis, although in spurts he seems to feel deflated and glossed over. He is adventurous, like Harry, and somewhat mischievous but always with good intentions, also like Harry. Ron has a wry, skeptical sense of humor; if Harry is the bold leader of their trio and Hermione the textbook brain, Ron often acts as the defender and jester. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are Harry's best friends, although in this book, they often are in disagreement.
