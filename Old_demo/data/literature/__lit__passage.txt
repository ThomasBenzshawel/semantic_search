A Passage to India is a novel written by English author E. M. Forster, first published in 1924. The narrative unfolds in the fictional city of Chandrapore in British India during the early 20th century. The novel explores the complex relationships between the British colonizers and the Indian people, focusing on the experiences of Dr. Aziz, a young Indian Muslim physician, and his interactions with English visitors, particularly Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested. The plot takes a dramatic turn when an accusation of assault leads to a trial that exposes the deep-seated cultural misunderstandings and tensions between the British and Indian communities.

Forster’s novel is a nuanced exploration of cultural clashes, prejudices, and the impact of colonialism on both the colonizers and the colonized. The intricate portrayal of characters and the evocative depiction of the Indian landscape contribute to the novel's enduring significance in the realm of modernist literature. Contemporary readers continue to find relevance in A Passage to India as it addresses themes of identity, power dynamics, and the repercussions of colonial rule. The novel’s exploration of cultural and racial tensions remains a thought-provoking reflection on the complexities of human relationships and the consequences of imperialism.

In 1984, director David Lean made a critically and commerically successful film of A Passage to India that further solidified the impact of Forster’s 1924 novel on popular culture. The screeenplay for the film was adapted from a 1960 play by Indian-born playwright Santha Rama Rau (also called A Passage to India) that was itself an adaptation of the novel.
