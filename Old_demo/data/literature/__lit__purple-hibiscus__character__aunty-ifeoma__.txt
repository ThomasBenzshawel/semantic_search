Aunty Ifeoma is an important catalyst for change in the Achike family. For Mama, Aunty Ifeoma serves as an example of feminine power and perseverance. As a widowed matriarch who works hard to provide for her children, Aunty Ifeoma is proof that not every woman needs a husband’s guidance or income for survival. In her crafty defiance and careful handling of her brother, she illustrates that Papa is actually a mere human rather than a godlike figure who cannot be challenged. For Kambili, Aunty Ifeoma encourages critical thinking and vocal opposition. The free discourse in her home fosters Kambili’s understanding of the benefits of both defiance and free will. Aunty Ifeoma’s laughter also teaches Kambili that joy is omnipresent and also essential to life. To Jaja, Aunty Ifeoma represents freedom and hope. Her unwillingness to fold easily under the pressures of oppressors, as well as her active quests to create a better life for her family, exemplify the importance of fighting for change. As she touches each of their lives, Aunty Ifeoma teaches the persecuted members of the Achike family how to make space for growth.
