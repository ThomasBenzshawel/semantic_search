Sonia, formally known as Sonali, is the youngest child of Ashima and Ashoke and the sister of Gogol, who she affectionately refers to as Goggles. Although much of the novel portrays Sonia peripherally, her presence goes a long way to juxtapose and clarify Gogol’s character. For example, from an early age Sonia is described as being naturally “American.” For one thing, her parents avoid the naming difficulties Gogol must contend with by planning out Sonia’s name in advance. For another, during a ceremony when Sonia is less than a year old, she rejects the ceremonial meal her parents give her as well as a symbolic dollar bill, which she attempts to eat. This show of disobedience is seen by the guests as uniquely American and charming; Gogol’s compliance during his own ceremony is shown to be what’s expected of a Bengali child.

Despite her natural affinity for all things American, Sonia feels the pull of her Bengali identity, much like Gogol. She attends college in California, only to move back in with Ashima after her father’s death. Sonia is drawn by the independence offered in America, yet she still feels connected to her Indian background through her family. Unlike Gogol, Sonia appears able to balance the two.

Eventually, Sonia becomes engaged to a journalist named Ben. Sonia and Ben are portrayed as an idyllic couple which, coupled with their successful wedding planning, starkly contrasts with Gogol’s own experiences. Where Gogol has an Indian marriage, Sonia does not. Where Gogol and Moushumi never quite seem like a perfect match, Sonia and Ben do so immediately. Both facts serve to highlight the apparent ease with which Sonia embodies her dual identity, relative to Gogol’s struggles. However, despite Sonia’s ability to assimilate into America more easily than Gogol, this never evolves into conflict between the siblings.
