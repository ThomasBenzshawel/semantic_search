Novelist E. M. Forster famously criticized
				Dickens’s characters as “flat,” lamenting that they seem to lack
				the depth and complexity that make literary characters realistic
				and believable. Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette certainly fit this
				description. A man of honor, respect, and courage, Darnay conforms
				to the archetype of the hero but never exhibits the kind of inner
				struggle that Carton and Doctor Manette undergo. His opposition
				to the Marquis’ snobbish and cruel aristocratic values is admirable, but,
				ultimately, his virtue proves too uniform, and he fails to exert
				any compelling force on the imagination.

Along similar lines, Lucie likely seems to modern readers
				as uninteresting and two-dimensional as Darnay. In every detail
				of her being, she embodies compassion, love, and virtue; the indelible image
				of her cradling her father’s head delicately on her breast encapsulates
				her role as the “golden thread” that holds her family together.
				She manifests her purity of devotion to Darnay in her unquestioning
				willingness to wait at a street corner for two hours each day, on
				the off chance that he will catch sight of her from his prison window.
				In a letter to Dickens, a contemporary criticized such simplistic
				characterizations:

While Darnay and Lucie may not act as windows
				into the gritty essence of humanity, in combination with other characters
				they contribute to a more detailed picture of human nature. First,
				they provide the light that counters the vengeful Madame Defarge’s
				darkness, revealing the moral aspects of the human soul so noticeably
				absent from Madame Defarge. Second, throughout the novel they manifest
				a virtuousness that Carton strives to attain and that inspires his
				very real and believable struggles to become a better person.
