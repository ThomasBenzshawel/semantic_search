A German Jesuit priest living in Hiroshima, Father Kleinsorge
				selflessly comforts many of the dying and wounded in the immediate aftermath
				of the bombing, as well as in the years following. While he is not
				seriously injured by the bombing, he falls prey to radiation sickness
				and becomes weak and tired, often requiring lengthy -hospital stays.

	Father Kleinsorge is the only non-Japanese person profiled
				in the narrative. Although before the bombing he often felt that
				he was under suspicion as a foreigner living in Japan, his experiences
				afterward are not very different from those of the other victims.
				His experiences demonstrate how the bomb served as an equalizer:
				all people affected by it suffered and came together to help, regardless of
				their background. At the same time, Father Kleinsorge gives the readers
				a distinct, non-Japanese view of some significant events, such as
				his amazement at how the majority of Japanese victims suffer silently
				and with dignity.

	Father Kleinsorge’s life does not drastically change
				after the bombing—when we first meet him, he is already physically
				weak from the wartime diet—but he does become so enamored with the Japanese
				that he decides to become a citizen himself, taking the name Father
				Makoto Takakura. This unexpected gesture reflects positively on
				the Japanese people, and also symbolizes the community strength
				and dedication that came about in response to the bombing.
