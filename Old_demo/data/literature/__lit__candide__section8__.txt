On the way to Constantinople with Cacambo and his master,
					Candide and Martin learn that Cacambo bought Cunégonde and the old
					woman from Don Fernando, but that a pirate abducted them and sold
					them as slaves. Cunégonde has grown horribly ugly, but Candide resolves
					to love her anyway. Candide purchases Cacambo’s freedom. Upon arriving
					in Turkey, Candide recognizes two galley slaves as the baron and
					Pangloss. Candide also buys their freedom.

While the group travels to rescue Cunégonde, the baron
					and Pangloss tell their stories. The baron bears no ill will toward
					Candide for stabbing him. After his wound healed, Spanish troops
					attacked him and sent him to jail in Buenos Aires. The baron eventually returned
					to Rome to serve his Jesuit order, but was caught bathing naked
					with a young Turkish man and sent to the galleys.

	The executioner who was to hang Pangloss was inexperienced
					in hangings and made the noose badly, so Pangloss survived. A surgeon
					bought Pangloss’s body for dissection. Pangloss regained consciousness
					after being cut open, and the startled surgeon sewed him closed
					again. Pangloss then traveled to Constantinople. He entered a mosque
					and saw a pretty young woman drop her nosegay from her bosom. Pangloss
					picked it up and returned it to her bosom “with the most respectful
					attentions.” Her male companion thought he was taking too long with
					it, so he had Pangloss arrested. Pangloss was then whipped and sent
					to the galleys. However, he still believes that pre-established
					harmony is the “finest notion in the world.”

Candide purchases the old woman, Cunégonde, and a small
					farm. Cunégonde reminds Candide of his promise to marry her. Though horrified
					by her ugliness, Candide does not dare refuse. However, the baron
					again declares that he will not live to see his sister marry beneath
					her rank.

I should like to know which is worse,
						being raped a hundred times by negro pirates . . . or . . . just
						sitting here and doing nothing?	

Pangloss draws up a formal treatise declaring that the
					baron has no rights over his sister. Martin is in favor of drowning
					the baron. Cacambo suggests that they return the baron to the galleys
					without telling Cunégonde, and that is the course they choose.

Cunégonde grows uglier and more disagreeable every day. Cacambo
					works in the garden of the small farm. He hates the work and curses
					his fate. Pangloss is unhappy because he has no chance of becoming
					an important figure in a German university. Martin is patient because
					he imagines that in any other situation he would be equally unhappy.
					They all debate philosophy while the misery of the world continues.
					Pangloss still maintains that everything is for the best but no
					longer truly believes it. Paquette and Giroflée arrive at the farm,
					having squandered the money Candide gave them. They are still unhappy,
					and Paquette is still a prostitute.

	The group consults a famous dervish (Muslim holy man)
					about questions of good and evil. The dervish rebukes them for caring about
					such questions and shuts the door in their faces. Later, the group
					stops at a roadside farm. The farmer kindly invites them to a pleasant
					dinner. He only has a small farm, but he and his family work hard
					on it and live a tolerable existence.

	Candide finds the farmer’s life appealing. He, Cunégonde,
					and his friends decide to follow it, and everyone is satisfied by
					hard work in the garden. Pangloss suggests to Candide once again
					that this is the best of possible worlds. Candide responds, “That
					is very well put . . . but we must cultivate our garden.”

—Let’s work without speculating, said
						Martin; it’s the only way of rendering life bearable.	

The far-fetched resurrections of Pangloss and the baron
					can be read optimistically or pessimistically. On the one hand,
					two events that gave Candide great grief, the death of his teacher
					and his own murder of his old friend, have been reversed in an almost
					miraculous fashion. Candide’s most impossible wish has come true.
					On the other hand, even the fulfillment of that wish brings Candide
					no real happiness. In fact, the baron actively works to thwart Candide’s happiness.
					Additionally, even near-death experiences and imprisonment have
					done nothing to alter Pangloss’s shallow optimism and the baron’s
					brutish snobbery. Pangloss represents human folly and the baron
					represents human arrogance, and Voltaire seems to be saying that
					neither ever really dies.

	While Candide’s optimism has fluctuated during his travels,
					Pangloss’s has remained static, despite the fact that he has arguably fared
					far worse than his pupil. Pangloss desires consistency in his thinking,
					an aspiration that seems rational. However, Pangloss’s version of
					consistency involves an irrational refusal to denounce his excessively
					optimistic philosophy despite the terrible situations he has encountered.
					Pangloss no longer even really believes his own words, but he refuses
					to incorporate his new knowledge into his philosophy. For him, the
					idea is more important and attractive than reality. The hopeless
					rigidity of Pangloss’s thought is sharply and concisely illustrated
					by this exchange:

Money, leisure, security, peace, and life with his beloved
					do not make Candide happy. Martin declares that humans are bound
					to live “either in convulsions of misery or in the lethargy of boredom.” The
					way out of this dilemma, it seems, lies in the lifestyle of the farmer
					and in Candide’s garden. Candide manages to find a tolerable existence
					through self-directed improvement and work. Practical action is
					the only solution Voltaire can find to the problem of human suffering.
					Each member of the household finds a skill to hone and then uses
					it to contribute to the support of the household. Without any leisure
					from their toil in the garden, the characters have no time or energy
					to trade empty words about good and evil. Candide’s new solution
					seems to alleviate some of their suffering. Pangloss points out
					that the garden in which everyone finds solace is reminiscent of
					the biblical Garden of Eden, but there are crucial differences.
					The characters of Candide are ending their adventures
					in a garden, not beginning them there as Adam and Eve did; and instead of
					enjoying the free bounty of nature as Adam and Eve did, they must
					work tirelessly in order to reap any benefits from their garden.

	The sincerity of Voltaire’s endorsement of this solution
					is questionable. It seems unlikely that, after having poked malicious
					fun at countless belief systems, Voltaire should decide to give
					his readers an unqualified happy ending. The characters finally
					realize their desires, but misery still reigns in the world outside
					their garden. Candide and his friends are wealthy and secure—in
					a perfect position to try to change the world for the better. Yet,
					rather than engaging the world in an attempt to improve it, they
					withdraw from it in an attempt to escape their own petty unhappiness.
					Voltaire, who became very active in political and social causes
					later in his life, may see withdrawal into a garden as the only
					wise and viable solution for creatures as weak as human beings.
					However, it is unlikely that he sees it as the best of all possible
					solutions.
