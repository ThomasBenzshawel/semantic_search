Anne announces that she is determined to enjoy the ride
					back to Mrs. Spencer’s orphanage. Marilla, realizing that Anne must
					talk about something, decides to pick the topic herself, and asks
					Anne about her past. Anne says she would prefer to tell what she
					imagines about herself, as her imagination is so much richer than
					her history, but she agrees to tell her story. Her parents, Walter
					and Bertha Shirley, were teachers, and both died of fever when Anne
					was a baby. She was adopted by Mrs. Thomas, a poor woman with a
					drunken husband, who wanted Anne only so she would have help with
					her children. Eight years later, after the death of Mr. Thomas,
					Mrs. Thomas gave Anne to another poor woman, Mrs. Hammond, and Anne cared
					for Mrs. Hammond’s three sets of twins. After two years, Mr. Hammond
					died, and Anne was sent to the orphanage, where she lived for four
					months. She received little schooling but compensated for her lack
					of formal education by reading voraciously. 

	After hearing Anne’s sad history, Marilla pities her
					for the first time. Anne, however, refuses to feel sorry for herself,
					crediting her various foster mothers with good intentions, even
					if the women were not always kind. Marilla begins to consider keeping
					Anne. She thinks Anne ladylike and supposes Anne could easily be
					trained out of her bad habits.

Marilla and Anne arrive at Mrs. Spencer’s orphanage and
					explain the mistake. Mrs. Spencer apologizes and says that the situation
					will work out for the best anyway. Another woman, Mrs. Peter Blewett, wants
					to adopt a girl to help with her rambunctious children, so Anne
					can be handed over to her, allowing the Cuthberts to adopt the boy
					they originally wanted. This news does not please Marilla, for Mrs.
					Blewett is known for her nastiness and stinginess, and for driving
					her servants hard. Marilla feels a twinge of guilt at the thought
					of relinquishing Anne to her. Mrs. Blewett comes to borrow a recipe from
					Mrs. Spencer, and her presence terrifies Anne. Marilla takes Anne
					back to Green Gables, saying she needs time to think about the proposition. 

At home, she tells Matthew that she is willing to keep
					Anne if he agrees not to interfere with her child-rearing methods.
					Marilla admits to nervousness at the prospect of raising a girl
					but tells Matthew, “Perhaps an old maid doesn’t know much about
					bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor.”
					Matthew, delighted by Marilla’s decision, asks only that Marilla
					be good and kind to Anne. Marilla reflects that she has invited
					a challenge into her life. She cannot quite believe what she is
					about to do, and she is even more surprised that Matthew, famous
					for his fear of women, is so adamant about keeping Anne. She decides
					to wait until the following day to tell Anne of their decision.

At bedtime, Marilla begins her program of moral and social
					education for Anne. She scolds Anne for leaving her clothes all
					over the floor the previous night and for failing to pray before
					bed. Anne replies that she has never said a prayer and does not
					know how to pray, though she would be happy to learn. Anne begins
					to ruminate on the language of prayer and religion. At the asylum,
					she was taught that God is “infinite, eternal, and unchangeable,”
					a description she thought grand. She explains that she rejected
					God because Mrs. Thomas told her God gave her red hair on purpose.

Despite her distaste for God, Anne wants to oblige Marilla. Marilla,
					horrified that a near-heathen is staying under her roof, begins
					to teach Anne the prayer “Now I lay me down to sleep,” but she senses
					that this prayer for innocent children is inappropriate for Anne,
					who has already had such a hard life. She lets Anne create her own
					prayer, and Anne improvises a flowery speech thanking God for such
					gifts as Bonny the geranium and the White Way of Delight, which
					is what she calls the main road of Avonlea. She prays for Green
					Gables to become her home, and to become pretty when she grows up.
					She ends the prayer by saying, “Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley.”
					Marilla resolves to send Anne to Sunday school as soon as she can
					make her some proper clothes.

The next afternoon, Anne begs Marilla to tell her whether
					she can stay at Green Gables. Marilla makes Anne wash the dishcloth
					in hot water before announcing that she can stay. When Anne hears
					the good news, she cries with happiness, promising to be good and
					obedient, two qualities she senses Marilla values above all others.
					Anne asks whether she should continue to refer to Marilla as Miss
					Cuthbert or whether she might call her Aunt Marilla. Calling Marilla
					her aunt, says Anne, would be almost as good as having an actual
					relative. Marilla says Anne should call her Marilla.

	Afraid that Anne might repeat the prayer debacle of the
					previous night, Marilla instructs Anne to retrieve a copy of the
					Lord’s Prayer from the next room and memorize it. Anne does not
					return for ten minutes. Marilla finds her kneeling before a picture
					entitled “Christ Blessing Little Children,” rapt and starry-eyed.
					Anne is imagining herself as a little girl in the picture whom the
					other children ignore but who creeps into the crowd hoping for Christ’s
					attention and blessing. Marilla chastises her for being irreverent,
					which surprises Anne.

	Anne sits at the kitchen table to memorize Lord’s Prayer.
					She asks Marilla if she will have a “bosom friend” or “kindred spirit”
					at Avonlea. Marilla says a little girl named Diana Barry lives nearby, and
					Anne asks about Diana’s hair color, saying red hair in a bosom friend
					would be unendurable. She tells Marilla about her previous best
					friends, both imaginary. At Mrs. Thomas’s, she created an imaginary
					best friend to whom she spoke in the glass door of a bookcase. When
					she moved to Mrs. Hammond’s, she found a new best friend in the
					echo of her own voice in a nearby valley. Marilla, fed up with Anne’s
					chatter, sends her to her room, where she daydreams. She tries to
					imagine that she is Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald, but finding this persona
					unconvincing, she appeases herself with her new real name: Anne
					of Green Gables.

In these chapters, we learn that Anne has had a difficult
					life. She realizes that her foster mothers did not care for her;
					they simply wanted a maid and a babysitter. Considering the pain
					of Anne’s life, her refusal to criticize her foster mothers makes
					her seem strong and surprisingly optimistic. She also expresses
					satisfaction in her friends, although they were imaginary. Along
					with her strength and optimism, Anne possesses a mature ability
					to use herself as a resource and find happiness in her own company.
				

Anne is guided not by the rules of social decorum but
					by her imagination, as Marilla recognizes when she lets Anne make
					up her own prayer rather than recite “Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.”
					For Anne, the reality that society presents can be altered by imagining
					a different reality. She thinks her own name and life dull, so she renames
					herself Cordelia and imagines herself a fine lady. She does not
					have friends, so she makes friends of her reflection and voice. She
					sees the good in people and places, and then imagines them as even
					better than they are. 

	Anne practices her own form of spirituality, which she
					has developed independently and which consists of a belief that
					miracles and perfection exist in life.  Demoralizing experiences
					have turned her away from Christian tenets and toward a spiritual
					life centered on love of the natural world. Marilla cannot understand
					Anne’s form of spirituality because it diverges from traditional
					religion. When Marilla asks Anne to pray in a Christian way, Anne
					begins to forge a mixture of her own spirituality and Marilla’s
					religion. Anne prays before bed as Marilla’s religion dictates,
					but she makes up her own flowery, unorthodox prayer. She looks at
					Marilla’s picture of Christ, but she uses her imagination to insert
					herself into the scene. 

Although Marilla disapproves of Anne’s infractions, she
					does sympathize with Anne and begins to temper her sternness with
					sympathy. Although she insists that Anne call her Marilla instead
					of using the more affectionate name Aunt Marilla, she exhibits compassion
					for Anne, pitying her plight at the hands of cruel foster mothers,
					and refusing to hand her over to the unpleasant Mrs. Blewett. She
					does not even criticize Anne for her unorthodox prayer; although
					she comes down hard on Anne’s improper behavior, she understands
					that Anne acts oddly not because of perversity or rebelliousness,
					but because she has never been taught differently. She seems to
					know that Anne has a good heart and wants to do the right thing.
