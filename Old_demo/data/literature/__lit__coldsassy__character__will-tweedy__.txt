Many critics have likened Will Tweedy to the boy hero
				Huckleberry Finn from Mark Twain’s novel The Adventures
					of Huckleberry Finn. Like Huck, whose travels in the South
				help him learn about life, Will’s experiences help him understand
				such complex issues as death, prejudice, and love. Will narrates
				the novel, and although he is twenty-two when he narrates the events
				of the story years later, he recaptures the adolescent humor and
				innocent perspective that allow him to view his grandfather’s marriage
				and the ways of the South with unbiased eyes. This youthful voice
				keeps the narrative lively, while his adolescent humor lightens
				the novel’s serious examinations of death and morality. 

	In many ways, Will Tweedy and Rucker Blakeslee are the
				same man at opposite ends of life’s spectrum. Critics frequently
				describe Will as the mirror image of Rucker in outward appearance
				and personality. Will and Rucker share a penchant for practical
				jokes, storytelling, and fighting. Their characters also progress
				along the same arc—though in different directions—over the course
				of the story. The novel tells the story of Will’s maturation and
				Rucker’s renaissance. Will must learn from his grandfather how to
				speak his mind and discard the social constraints of Cold Sassy.
				As Will learns to become defiant and brave, Rucker, whose defiance
				hardened him, learns to become happy and youthful. Both Will and
				Rucker move toward the middle point on the spectrum.
