Tsezar is a well-to-do, cultured prisoner who strikes
				awe in Shukhov and who represents worldliness and abundance. His
				regular parcels of lush food items grant him special privileges
				in the camp that make his fellow prisoners envious. He is allowed
				to eat in the camp office rather than in the mess hall and to wear
				a fur cap, for example, and the fact that he has obtained such privileges
				from the frigid Soviet officers greatly increases his stature. But
				Tsezar’s relative glamour derives also from his cultured background.
				He is from Moscow, a wondrous city of which Shukhov can only dream,
				and he enjoys discussing film with Buynovsky.

Tsezar’s material abundance gives a deeper significance
				to his name, which is a Russian form of “Caesar,” a title that many
				Roman emperors adopted. Tsezar’s name reminds us of Jesus’ reference
				in the New Testament to Caesar as a symbol of worldly pursuits that stand
				in the way of spiritual well-being. For Shukhov, Tsezar represents
				the earthly pleasures that Alyoshka, the spokesman for nourishing
				the soul, urges Shukhov to reject at the end of the novel.
