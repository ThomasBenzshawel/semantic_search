The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a novel by Victor Hugo that was first published in 1831 (as Notre-Dame de Paris). One of the first great novels of the Romantic era, it has entertained generations of readers with its powerfully melodramatic story of Quasimodo, the hunchback who lives in the bell tower of medieval Paris’s most famous cathedral. An epic tale of beauty and sadness, The Hunchback of Notre Dame portrays the sufferings of humanity with compassion and power.
