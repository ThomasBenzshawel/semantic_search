Many at Hogwarts have reason to fear Severus Snape, a
				reformed Death Eater now teaching at the school, who skulks around,
				sneering and hissing at Harry Potter. Even though Harry and his
				friends despise Snape, Dumbledore continues to trust him implicitly,
				dismissing Harry’s stories about overhearing Snape plotting with Draco
				and insisting that Snape is completely trustworthy, an irreplaceable
				member of the Hogwarts staff. Harry’s father, James Potter, was
				also at odds with Snape, and members of the Order of the Phoenix
				suggest that Harry’s inherent dislike of Snape was inherited from
				James. Harry is appropriately devastated when he learns that Snape
				and his beloved Half-Blood Prince are one and the same.

Although Harry sees Snape’s shiftiness as black and white,
				Rowling is purposefully vague about Snape’s true allegiances. Although Harry
					Potter and the Half-Blood Prince features a pointed scene
				in which Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow to Narcissa Malfoy, promising
				to protect Draco and take over his Dark duties, if necessary, there
				are still signs that point to Snape’s allegiance to Dumbledore.
				Moments before Dumbledore is murdered, Dumbledore freezes Harry,
				presumably to prevent him from stopping Snape. Likewise, Dumbledore
				appears to be stalling Draco until Snape can arrive, after specifically
				requesting that Harry call for Snape and not Madam Pomfrey— making
				it seem possible that Dumbledore wishes for Snape to be his killer.
				When Harry chases after Snape, Snape prevents Harry from casting
				any death spells, but once again does not try to kill Harry himself.
				Snape is an extremely complex and multi-faceted character.
