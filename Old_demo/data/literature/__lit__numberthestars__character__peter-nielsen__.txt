Peter is a young and brave member of the Resistance. He visits the Johansens by night, breaking curfew to see them. Peter is the most directly defiant character in the novel. He has no family that we know of and the Germans killed the love of his life. Though he is described as having been joyful in earlier years, the Peter of Number the Stars is intense and serious. Nothing gets in the way of Peter's mission. His participation in the Resistance is what defines him. Peter can be seen as the prototypical young rebel, though he is quiet and composed. One can sense his willingness to go beyond the call of duty. He is determined to help the Jews and defy the Nazis at all costs.
