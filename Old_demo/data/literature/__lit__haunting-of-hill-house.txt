The Haunting of Hill House, Shirley Jackson’s 1959 horror novel, is one of the American novelist and short story writer’s best-known works. The novel is told from the perspective of its unreliable protagonist Eleanor, and it is an example of a subgenre known as the psychological ghost story. In this subgenre, events occur because of the unbalanced mental state of the main character, not because of supernatural entities. The novel was adapted for film as The Haunting in both 1963 and 1999. In 2018, the story was reimagined in a Netflix television series under its original title.
