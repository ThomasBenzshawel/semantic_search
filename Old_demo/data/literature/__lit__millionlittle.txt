A Million Little Pieces, published in 2003, is a semi-fictional mid-life memoir by American author James Frey. It vividly recounts the author’s struggles with addiction and his journey to recovery, detailing the physical and emotional challenges he faced while residing in a rehabilitation facility. When an investigation by the website The Smoking Gun uncovered evidence of factual inaccuracies, Frey admitted that certain events in his narrative were embellished or fabricated. This prompted a public reprimand from Oprah Winfrey, who had promoted the book. Despite the controversy, the book’s gripping portrayal of addiction, redemption, and human resilience resonates with readers.
