Candide’s new valet Cacambo is fond of his master and
					urges Candide to follow the old woman’s advice. Cacambo tells Candide
					not to worry about Cunégonde because God always takes care of women.
					Cacambo suggests that they fight on the side of the rebellious Paraguayan
					Jesuits. The two reach the rebel guard and ask to speak to the colonel,
					but the colonel orders their weapons and their horses seized. A
					sergeant tells Candide and Cacambo that the colonel does not have
					time to see them and that the Father Provincial hates Spaniards.
					He gives them three hours to get out of the province. Cacambo informs
					the sergeant that Candide is German. The colonel agrees to see him.

	Candide and Cacambo are led to the colonel’s
					lavish pavilion. Their weapons and horses are returned. It turns
					out that the colonel is Cunégonde’s brother, now the baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh.
					Candide and the baron embrace one another in tearful joy. Candide
					reports that Cunégonde also survived the attack and that she is
					with the governor. While they wait for the Father Provincial, the
					colonel tells his story.

When the Bulgars attacked the castle, the colonel was
					left unconscious and appeared dead. He was thrown into a cart full
					of corpses and taken to a Jesuit chapel for burial. A Jesuit sprinkling
					holy water on the bodies noticed the colonel’s eyes moving, and
					immediately made arrangements for the colonel’s care. After three
					weeks the colonel recovered completely. Being a “very pretty boy,”
					he earned the “tender friendship” of a highly regarded Jesuit and
					eventually became a Jesuit himself. He was sent to Paraguay, where
					he became a colonel as well as a priest.

	The colonel hopes to bring Cunégonde to Paraguay. Candide says
					he wishes to do the same because he plans to marry her. This statement
					infuriates the colonel, as Candide is not of the nobility. Candide
					claims that he agrees with Pangloss’s statement that all men are
					equal, and reminds the colonel how much he has done for Cunégonde
					and how happily she agreed to marry him. The colonel slaps Candide
					with his sword, and Candide responds by running the colonel through
					with his own sword. Candide bursts into tears. Cacambo rushes into
					the room. He dresses Candide in the colonel’s habit, and they flee
					the pavilion.

Candide and Cacambo end up in a strange country with no
					roads. They see two naked women running in a meadow pursued by two monkeys
					biting at their legs. Candide hopes he can rescue the women and
					gain their assistance, and so he kills the monkeys. However, instead
					of being grateful the women fall to the ground and weep over the
					dead monkeys. Cacambo informs Candide that the monkeys were the
					women’s lovers. Candide and Cacambo hide in a thicket where they
					fall asleep.

	They awaken to find themselves bound and surrounded by
					a tribe of fierce natives known as Biglugs. The Biglugs rejoice,
					excited that they are going to get revenge on the Jesuits by eating
					one. Cacambo tells them in their language that Candide is not a
					Jesuit. He explains that Candide killed a Jesuit and wore the Jesuit
					habit to escape. He urges the Biglugs to take the habit to the border
					and ask the guards to confirm the story. The Biglugs do so and discover
					that Cacambo is telling the truth. They show Candide and Cacambo
					the greatest hospitality and accompany them to the edge of their
					territory. Candide affirms his faith in the perfection of the world.

In eighteenth-century Europe, the Americas
					represented the long-standing promise of a new and brighter future
					for mankind. The New World attracted clergy in search of converts,
					merchants in search of riches, and countless adventurers in search
					of new adventure. In Chapter 10, Candide
					expresses the hope that the New World is the perfect world Pangloss
					spoke of, since the Old World clearly is not.

	By the eighteenth century, however, the dark side of
					colonization had already emerged. Educated individuals knew about
					the horrors of slavery, the oppression of natives, and the diseases
					spread by inter-cultural contact (of which Pangloss’s syphilis is
					one example). In these chapters and those that follow, Voltaire
					portrays the Americas as a region thoroughly corrupted by the vices
					of the Old World.

	The rebellion in Paraguay exposes the hypocrisy and scheming
					of South American politics. The Jesuit priests lead a revolt of
					native peoples against the Spanish colonial government, yet the
					Jesuits are not fighting for the right to self-government for these
					downtrodden natives. The Biglugs’ attitude toward Jesuits makes
					it clear that the native peoples feel no kinship with the priests
					who claim to be fighting for them. Instead, the Jesuits merely exploit
					the rebels in a greedy campaign to grab wealth and power away from
					the government. The native Paraguayans are the impoverished servants
					of powerful, wealthy European dissidents, mere pawns in an economic—not ideological—quarrel
					between Europeans.

	In this section, Voltaire seizes another opportunity
					to mock the hypocrisy of religious leaders and the aristocracy.
					The colonel tells Candide how a Jesuit priest took him into the
					order because he found him physically attractive. These leading
					comments suggest a homosexual relationship between the colonel and
					his mentor, a situation the Jesuits rigorously and publicly condemned.
					The colonel’s refusal to allow Candide to marry his sister, even
					after their emigration to America and after hearing all of what
					Candide has done for Cunégonde, is another example of European aristocratic
					arrogance.

	The description of the Biglugs can be read
					as a criticism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s philosophy. Rousseau,
					another important French Enlightenment thinker, was a bitter rival
					of Voltaire’s. Rousseau viewed man as naturally good and insisted
					that only the institutions of human civilization, such as property
					and commerce, corrupt man’s innate goodness. He was interested in the
					figure of the natural man, whom he called the “noble savage.” Rousseau
					held that, in a state of nature without the trappings of civilization,
					human beings would be ignorant of all vice. Voltaire, conversely,
					was far more pessimistic about human nature. He describes the Biglugs
					as men in a state of nature, but they are not noble savages ignorant
					of vice. Rather, they are filled with the same prejudices and brutality
					as people from the Old World. Like the Inquisitors in Portugal,
					they kill people based on their religious affiliation, and like
					the officers in the city of Azov, they are willing to practice cannibalism.

	Cacambo is an interesting exception to Voltaire’s bleak
					view of the New World. Cacambo is of mixed Spanish and Native American ancestry,
					but he has managed to avoid many of the misfortunes that have befallen
					both groups in the New World. He deals capably with both the Jesuits
					and the Biglugs and can speak both native and European languages.
					He suffers fewer gross misfortunes than any other character, less
					out of luck than because of his sharp wits, and he proves to be
					unflaggingly loyal and honest. Though Voltaire does not see hope
					for a new, better world for the European in the Americas, Cacambo
					seems to represent a different hope: a new, better man who is neither
					completely of the Old World nor completely of the New, who bases
					his personality and ability on his understanding and experience
					of both worlds.

	Though Cacambo inspires optimism in others, he himself
					is no optimist. His wide experience of the world leads him to the
					same conclusions as the old woman: he tells the Biglugs that “the
					law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbor, and that’s how men
					behave the whole world over.”
