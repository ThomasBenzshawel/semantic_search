Arms and the Man is a classic play written by George Bernard Shaw, first performed in 1894. Set during the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, the play satirizes the romantic notions of war and heroism prevalent in the society of that time. The plot revolves around Raina Petkoff, a young Bulgarian woman engaged to the gallant but somewhat absurd soldier Sergius Saranoff. Raina’s perspective on love and war is challenged when a pragmatic and unconventional Swiss mercenary, Captain Bluntschli, seeks refuge in her bedroom after deserting a battle.

Shaw uses Arms and the Man to criticize the glorification of war and the ideals associated with heroism. Through witty dialogue and clever characterization, the play explores the contrast between the romanticized notions of love and warfare and the practical, often comical, reality of these concepts.

Published in the late 19th century, Arms and the Man reflects the societal attitudes and political tensions of the time, particularly regarding conflicts in the Balkans. The play’s themes, however, remain relevant, offering a timeless critique of cultural notions of war and the complex interplay between love and reality.
