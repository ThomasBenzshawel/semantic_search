Cacambo and Candide continue to travel, but their horses
					die and their food runs out. They find an abandoned canoe and row
					down a river, hoping to find signs of civilization. After a day,
					their canoe smashes against some rocks.

	Cacambo and Candide make their way to a village, where
					they find children playing with emeralds, rubies, and diamonds.
					When the village schoolmaster calls the children, they leave the
					jewels on the ground. Candide tries to give the jewels to the schoolmaster,
					but the schoolmaster merely throws them back to the ground.

	Cacambo and Candide visit the village inn, which looks
					like a European palace. The people inside speak Cacambo’s native
					language. Cacambo and Candide eat a grand meal and try to pay for
					it with two large gold pieces they picked up off the ground. The
					landlord laughs at them for trying to give him “pebbles.” Moreover,
					the government maintains all inns for free. Candide believes that
					this is the place in the world where everything is for the best.

Cacambo and Candide go to see the village sage, a 172-year-old man.
					The sage explains that his people have vowed never to leave their
					kingdom, which is called Eldorado. High mountains surround the kingdom,
					so no outsiders can get in, making Eldorado safe from European conquests.
					They also have a God whom they thank every day for giving them what
					they need. No religious persecution occurs because everyone agrees
					about everything.

	Cacambo and Candide visit the king. They embrace him
					according to customs explained by one of his servants, and such
					familiarity and equality of address with a monarch shocks them.
					Candide asks to see the courts and prisons and learns there are
					none. Rather, there are schools devoted to the sciences and philosophy.

	After a month, Candide decides that he cannot stay in
					Eldorado as long as Cunégonde is not there. He decides to take as
					many Eldorado “pebbles” with him as he can. The king considers the
					plan foolish, but sets his architects to work building a machine
					to lift Candide, Cacambo, and 102 swift sheep
					loaded down with jewels out of the deep valley. Candide hopes to
					pay Don Fernando for Cunégonde and buy a kingdom for himself.

Cacambo and Candide lose all but two sheep as they travel
					to Surinam, but the last two sheep still carry a sizable fortune.
					Cacambo and Candide meet a slave on the road who is missing a leg
					and a hand. The slave tells them that his own mother sold him to
					his cruel master, Vanderdendur. He tells them of the misery of slavery,
					and his words prompt Candide to renounce Pangloss’s optimism.

	Candide sends Cacambo to retrieve Cunégonde
					and the old woman. Meanwhile, Candide tries to secure passage to
					Venice, and Vanderdendur offers his ship. When Candide readily agrees
					to Vanderdendur’s high price, Vanderdendur deduces that Candide’s
					sheep are carrying a fortune. Candide puts his sheep on board in
					advance, and Vanderdendur sails off without him, taking much of
					Candide’s fortune.

	Candide, at great expense, tries but fails to obtain
					compensation through the legal system. He then books passage on
					a ship sailing for France and announces that he will pay passage
					plus a good sum of money to the most unhappy man in the province.
					Out of the crowd of applicants, Candide chooses a scholar who was
					robbed by his wife, beaten by his son, and forsaken by his daughter.

Eldorado is Voltaire’s utopia, featuring no organized
					religion and no religious persecution. None of the inhabitants attempts
					to force beliefs on others, no one is imprisoned, and the king greets
					visitors as his equals. The kingdom has an advanced educational
					system and poverty is nonexistent. This world is clearly the best
					of the worlds represented in Candide and seems
					to be the “best of all possible worlds” in which Pangloss believes.

	However, Voltaire’s deep pessimism about human nature
					shines through the glittering portrait of the harmonious, utopian
					society of Eldorado. The word “utopia,” coined by Sir Thomas More
					in his book of the same name, sounds like the Greek words for both
					“good place” and “no place.” For the suffering inhabitants of the
					real world, Eldorado might as well not exist. It is almost completely inaccessible
					from the outside. Riches enough to end world poverty lie untouched
					on the ground. Its residents refuse to initiate any contact with
					the outside world because they know that such contact would destroy
					their perfect country. After some time there, even Candide wants
					to return immediately to the deeply flawed world outside. The Eldorado
					“pebbles” will only be of value to him in the outside world. The
					jewels that make Eldorado beautiful serve to inspire greed and ambition
					in Candide, whose only previous interests have been survival and
					his love for Cunégonde.

	The fortune that Candide obtains in Eldorado brings him
					more problems than advantages. He quickly discovers that riches
					make him into a target for all sorts of swindlers, as Vanderdendur
					and the Surinamese officers swiftly work to get as much money from
					Candide as they can. Before he becomes wealthy, Candide still repeatedly
					finds cause to endorse Pangloss’s optimism. After he acquires wealth,
					however, the fierce blows he suffers shatter his confidence in optimism.
					Financial injury inspires more pessimism in him than violence ever
					did. His decision to listen to countless stories of woe and to reward
					the most miserable man is reminiscent of the old woman’s behavior
					on the trip to America, during which she asked the other passengers
					to recite their sad tales. This indicates that perhaps Candide identifies
					more with the old woman’s world-weary pessimism now that he has
					had money. By suggesting that Candide is sorrier to see his money
					disappear than he was to see his blood shed, Voltaire also comments
					on the hopeless irrationality of human priorities and on the power
					of greed.

	Candide’s attempt to acquire a companion for his voyage
					reveals the futility of trying to compensate someone for misery
					and suffering. There are so many miserable people in the world that
					giving away a little bit of money does virtually nothing to reduce
					this overall misery. Voltaire implies that the basis for misery
					is the social structure itself, which needs to be changed before
					any real compensation can occur.

	Candide’s new pessimism also owes something to his conversation
					with the slave whom he encounters on the road to Surinam. Voltaire
					illustrates social injustice and systematic cruelty many times in
					the novel. However, many of these situations, such as Candide’s
					conscription into the Bulgar army and the consumption of the old
					woman’s buttock, are exaggerated, absurd, or even comical. The slave’s
					life story, on the other hand, is quite realistic and has no element
					of humor to it. In dealing with slavery, Voltaire comes up against
					an evil so powerful that even his considerable satiric wit cannot
					make light of it.
