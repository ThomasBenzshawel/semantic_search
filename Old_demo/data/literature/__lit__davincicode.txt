Dan Brown’s 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code is a mystery thriller that was a massive best seller that has sold over 80 million copies worldwide. It follows Harvard professor Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu as they attempt to solve the murder of a curator at the Louvre and uncover a secret that could shake the foundations of Christianity. Brown’s fast-paced narrative combines art, history, and religious intrigue, creating a page-turner that explores the blurred lines between fact and fiction—lines that historical and scientific scholars point out Brown frequently crossed. The second of Brown’s five-volume (to date) Robert Langdon series (after Angels & Demons in 2000), The Da Vinci Code was adapted into a 2006 film directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks as Langdon.
