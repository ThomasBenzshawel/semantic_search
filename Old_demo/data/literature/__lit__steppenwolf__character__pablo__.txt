Pablo plays perhaps the most instrumental role in the
				changes that occur in Steppenwolf. Clues to his
				importance are present from his first mention in the narrative.
				Hermine foreshadows Pablo’s importance in her extreme admiration
				for him and her claim that he can play all instruments and speak
				all the languages of the world. The fact that Pablo is the character
				most associated with music provides a persistent cue to his significance.
				Indeed, he is a genius bandleader and therefore in charge of defining
				the rhythms to which all others must tune their behavior. Yet, despite
				Harry’s efforts to discover Pablo’s value, we have little to go
				on until the very close of the novel, when Pablo introduces Harry
				to the Magic Theater.

	In the Magic Theater, the seemingly simple-minded Pablo achieves
				his apotheosis, revealing himself to be the most enlightened figure
				in the story. In fact, an earlier criticism of Pablo—that he seemed
				unproblematic as a child—turns out to be a marker of his profound
				wisdom. Pablo’s wisdom does not require the stifling books and theories
				under which Harry has buried half his life. Rather, Pablo’s wisdom
				stems from lived experience, and from a deep consideration of the
				world that exists within one’s own soul. As Pablo explains to Harry,
				the important thing is to play music and play it well—not to waste
				time talking or theorizing about it. Pablo’s ability to shift effortlessly
				between his two saxophones as he plays symbolizes the ideal integration
				of the spiritual and the physical to which Harry aspires.
