Utnapishtim’s name means “He Who Saw Life,” though “He
				Who Saw Death” would be just as appropriate, since he witnessed
				the destruction of the entire world. The former king and priest
				of Shurrupak, Utnapishtim was the fortunate recipient of the god
				Ea’s favor. His disdain for Gilgamesh’s desperate quest for eternal
				life might seem ungenerous, since he himself is immortal, but Utnapishtim
				must carry a heavy load of survivor’s guilt. He doesn’t know why,
				of all the people in the world, Ea chose him to live, but he does know
				that he tricked hundreds of his doomed neighbors into laboring day
				and night to build the boat that would carry him and his family
				to safety while he abandoned them to their fates. What Utnapishtim
				gained by his trickery was a great boon for humankind, however.
				He received a promise from the gods that henceforth only individuals
				would be subject to death and that humankind as a whole would endure.
				When Utnapishtim tested Gilgamesh by asking him to stay awake for
				a week, he knew that he would fail, just as he knew that Gilgamesh
				wouldn’t profit from the magical plant that had the power to make
				him young again. Gilgamesh is one-third man, which is enough to
				seal his fate—all men are mortal and all mortals die. Yet since Utnapishtim
				“sees life,” he knows that life extends beyond the individual—that
				families, cities, and cultures endure.
