The horrors of war cause the chaplain to have his doubts
				about God, and he struggles to maintain his faith amid the senseless
				violence around him. One of the hardest things for the chaplain
				to deal with is the way that religion is constantly being co-opted
				for reasons having nothing to do with God or even with the comfort
				of the men. For example, the chaplain’s atheistic assistant, Corporal
				Whitcomb, wants to send form letters home to the families of men
				killed and wounded in combat. The chaplain objects because the letters
				are insincere, but Colonel Cathcart insists on the form letters
				because he believes that they will bring him recognition. Such events
				force the chaplain to realize that religion is not valued on its
				own terms, but only as a tool that the officers can use to further
				their own causes.

When three men drag the chaplain into an isolated cellar
				and accuse him of unspecified crimes, he realizes that, because
				they have the power to beat him to death, his innocence has become
				irrelevant. Shortly afterward, the chaplain fakes an ailment and
				checks into the hospital. He has realized that trying to exist within
				the rules is impossible; having justified sin to himself, he feels
				much better.

The chaplain’s character reminds us of one more way in
				which war upsets moral and ethical codes. Just as Doc Daneeka is
				confused about the role of a doctor in a world where man’s primary
				goal is to cause injury and death, the chaplain is disoriented by
				a world where killing has become a virtue.
