Franz Kafka’s The Trial, published posthumously in 1925, is a surreal and existential novel that unfolds the bewildering journey of Josef K., a seemingly innocent man, caught in an opaque and absurd judicial system. Accused of a crime he is unaware of, Josef navigates a nightmarish bureaucratic labyrinth, dealing with questions about the nature of guilt, authority, and justice along the way. Kafka's work remains a haunting exploration of the individual's struggle against a dehumanizing and labyrinthine judicial system.
