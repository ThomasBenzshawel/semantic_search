If Amir’s character arc is about growth, Hassan’s arc is about not changing at
                all. From the start and through his death, Hassan remains the same: loyal,
                forgiving, and good-natured. As a servant to Baba and Amir, Hassan grows up with a
                very particular role in life. While Amir prepares for school in the morning, Hassan
                readies Amir’s books and his breakfast. While Amir is at school getting an
                education, Hassan helps Ali with the chores and grocery shopping. As a result,
                Hassan learns that it is his duty to sacrifice himself for others. Furthermore, by
                nature he is not prone to envy, and he even tells Amir he is happy with what he has,
                though he sees all the time how much more Amir has. Hassan comes across as the
                personification of innocence as a result, and this innocence is crucial in creating
                the drama and symbolism of his rape by Assef. First, Hassan’s innocence gives Amir
                no justifiable reason to betray Hassan. Amir’s behavior cannot be rationalized,
                making it consummately selfish and reprehensible. Second, Hassan’s rape becomes the
                sacrifice of an innocent, a recurring motif in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism that
                carries a great deal of symbolic meaning.
