Published in 2007, Jay Asher’s debut YA novel, Thirteen Reasons Why, stayed on the New York Times Best Seller list for years before its paperback release. Librarians and teachers have praised Thirteen Reasons Why as an exceptional and important novel, but despite the book’s success, it has faced criticism for its focus on teen alcohol use, sexual assault, and suicide, resulting in its addition to the American Library Association’s list of most challenged and removed books. A 10th anniversary edition included an alternative what-if ending for Hannah and Clay. In 2017, Netflix adapted Thirteen Reasons Why into a series that ran for four seasons.
