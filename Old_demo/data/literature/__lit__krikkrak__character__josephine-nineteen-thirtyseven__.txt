Josephine knows well the painful legacy she has inherited. Her mother had
				to choose whether to save Josephine’s life or try to save her grandmother’s, so
				Josephine’s birth depended on her grandmother’s death. She feels a bond with her
				grandmother and her mother as a result of the rituals her mother made her take
				part in at Massacre River, even though she has never understood them. Josephine
				is awed by her mother’s rituals and stories, and she has absorbed them more than
				she realizes. When Jacqueline visits her, Josephine asks questions that only a
				fellow performer of the rituals would understand. Despite the strength this
				tradition gives her, Josephine feels overwhelmed by the depressing world around
				her and helpless to change it. She doesn’t know how to connect with her mother,
				perhaps because she is ashamed of her inability to help her. She attempts to be
				strong by hiding her profound sorrow. Though she cannot express it, Josephine
				highly values her relationship with her mother and the tradition of which she is
				part.
