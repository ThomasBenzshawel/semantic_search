Caroline is autonomous, the most well-adjusted of the three daughters. Raised by her older sisters, she had a relatively normal childhood. Caroline was protected from their lustful father by her sisters, who also provided her with the things that make a young girl happy: makeup, magazines, clothes, dates, spending money, and socializing. However, Caroline shows little or no gratitude toward Ginny and Rose. She goes off to college, becomes a wealthy lawyer, marries another lawyer, and shows no interest at all in the farm. As far as the older sisters know, Caroline was never abused by her father. In their final meeting, Ginny is certain of this as they talk about the past, so Ginny spares Caroline the sordid facts. Caroline does not change in the novel. She is pampered as a child and shielded from harm, proceeding into adulthood with confidence that her sisters lack.
