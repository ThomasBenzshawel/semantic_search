Hesse published Steppenwolf in 1927,
				after a failed marriage and two subsequent years of debauchery.
				Harry Haller’s age, profession, intellectual interests, and unpopular
				pacifist journalism match Hesse’s own. Hesse suggests that Harry
				is actually a reflection of himself. Just as the concept of “the
				Steppenwolf” is useful to Harry for self-analytical purposes, Harry
				is useful to Hesse as an illuminating fictional construction.

Harry is more like a theoretical framework than a believable, realistic
				character. He appears out of nowhere, inhabits a nameless space,
				and disappears again into nowhere when his usefulness evaporates.
				Harry is also an engaging character. The more mundane aspects of
				his existence—his admiration of his favorite wine, his embarrassment
				about his aging, his physical sufferings—are refreshingly lifelike
				and endearing. These touches soften Harry’s seemingly boundless
				despair and self-absorption.
