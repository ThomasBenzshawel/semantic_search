Atlas Shrugged is a novel by author and philosopher Ayn Rand that was first published in 1957. Her longest and most elaborate novel as well as her final fictional work, it is considered Randâ€™s crowning achievement as a fiction writer. In the novel, she traces the lives of several individuals who are involved in big business in the United States, exalting their will to succeed and their self-centered egoism. Atlas Shrugged fleshes out the philosophy of Objectivism that Rand had been developing throughout her life.
