Coming of Age in Mississippi is a memoir by writer and activist Anne Moody that was first published in 1968. This complex and haunting autobiography—which The Nation magazine described as “crude and undeniable and, against all principles of beauty, beautiful” when it was published—tells the story of Moody's childhood in poverty-stricken rural Mississippi and her determination to improve her life and the lives of those around her despite harsh, often brutal consequences. This most famously included Moody being one of the students at the May 28, 1963, Woolworth’s lunch-counter sit-in in Jackson, Mississippi.
