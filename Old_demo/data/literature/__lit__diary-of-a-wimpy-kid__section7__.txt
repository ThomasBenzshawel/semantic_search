A parent reports that Rowley has teased the kindergarteners, but it was actually Greg (wearing Rowleyâ€™s coat) who chased them with a worm on a stick. When Mr. Winsky, the teacher in charge of Safety Patrol, scolds Rowley and takes away his Safety Patrol badge for a week, Greg wonders if he should confess. After his mother advises him to do the right thing, Greg decides to let Rowley take the blame. Rowley tells on Greg, who gets permanently relieved of his duties while Rowley gets a promotion.
