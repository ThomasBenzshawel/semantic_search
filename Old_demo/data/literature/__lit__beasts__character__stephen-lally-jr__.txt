The older brother of Billy Lally, Lally one, from Kenilworth, Illinois, demonstrates behavior bordering on the psychotic. Engaged in fierce sibling rivalry with his brother, at times he treats his brother and his fellow campers with vengeful cruelty. In one particular incident, he kills Goodenow and Billy's pets after Cotton prevents him from sending a letter home. Most of his temper tantrums relate to his parents' inattentiveness to his needs. Since they travel frequently and are seldom home, Lally one and his brother struggle with each other to win their love.
