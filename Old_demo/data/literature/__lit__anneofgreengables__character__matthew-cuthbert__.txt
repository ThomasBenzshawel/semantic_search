At the age of sixty, Matthew is known as a strange, timid
				man. His painful shyness becomes paralyzing when he is forced to
				interact with women, and he spends most of his time away from people, working
				the land at Green Gables. Despite Matthew’s extreme shyness, Anne
				immediately appeals to him and sets him at ease. From the beginning,
				Matthew advocates for Anne. He expresses pride in all she does and
				seizes every opportunity to spoil her. Although when they adopt
				Anne Marilla makes Matthew promise not to interfere with the raising
				of the child, Matthew becomes increasingly involved in parental
				duties, especially when he feels Marilla is treating Anne too harshly.
				With his gentle persistence, he often wears away at Marilla until
				she agrees to let him and Anne have their way.

Whereas Anne and Marilla butt heads for years, Anne and
				Matthew instantly understand one another, and Anne listens to Matthew
				when no one else’s arguments can sway her. She recognizes him as
				a “kindred spirit” and confides in him when she wants a sympathetic
				ear. In contrast to Marilla’s manly severity and difficulty expressing
				emotion, Matthew exhibits motherly qualities. He openly tells Anne
				of his affection for her and pride in her, and he wants her to look
				pretty and feel comfortable with her friends. More gentle than Marilla,
				Matthew treats Anne with unflagging kindness. Anne influences Matthew
				positively; he loves her bright presence at Green Gables and becomes
				more outgoing and happier after she arrives.
