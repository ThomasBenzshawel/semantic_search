Esteban is obsessive, violent, and materialistic. He devotes
				his life to his business and political careers, determined first
				to become rich and then to become powerful. He owes much of his
				success to the labor of the peasants at Tres Marias, but he never
				treats them with respect or equality. From the time he becomes engaged
				to Clara through the end of his life, Esteban is passionately in
				love with her. His love for her is so strong it is like an obsession.
				It is not, however, enough to curb his temper, even toward her.
				Esteban achieves his material goals but is not able to be close
				to anyone except his granddaughter Alba. As he ages, Esteban begins
				to see the negative outcomes of his violent, selfish actions and
				becomes increasingly aware of how lonely he is.
