Although Orpheus appears in only two Books (X and XI),
				his presence resonates throughout the work. He is an artist, and
				the Metamorphoses is a poem preoccupied with the
				problems of art. Ovid portrays Orpheus as a being who transcends
				his limitations through art. Orpheus is a flawed man; in a matter
				of seventy lines, he loses his wife, Eurydice, twice. But when he
				starts singing, his shortcomings fade in importance. His songs comprise
				some of the most memorable and beautiful lines in the Metamorphoses.
				By the end of his song, we can no longer doubt his skill. Ovid creates
				a metamorphosis in our perception of Orpheus, transforming our pity
				into appreciation.
