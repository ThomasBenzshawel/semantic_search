Junior is Ishmael’s older brother and his closest companion, and he occupies a caring, compassionate role in Ishmael’s life, as evidenced by the many memories Ishmael has of Junior’s protectiveness. It’s Junior who gets Ishmael interested in rap music, and it’s this connection to rap music that later helps Ishmael fight off the conditioning of his military training. After the war begins and their lives are changed forever, rap music also serves as a means of reminding the boys of a happier time. As the fighting and the boys’ journey continues, Junior becomes more and more withdrawn. Still, Ishmael looks up to Junior and finds comfort in his presence before they are separated. Junior likely dies in the attack on Kamator, highlighting another possible fate for Ishmael and signifying a change in his character that ultimately gives way to a total loss of innocence.
