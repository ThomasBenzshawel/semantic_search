Bell, fifty-seven, is the sheriff of Terrell County who values justice, morality, and honesty. He enjoys a close relationship with his wife of more than thirty years, Loretta, and seems to have a job he relishes, good relations with his colleagues, and an important role in his community. Then Bell learns about Chigurh and sees the damage he leaves behind. The knowledge of this man makes him call into question his values and the future of society. 

Each of the chapters of the book opens with a first-person monologue from Bell, but these occur after the main action involving Chigurh, Moss, and Carla Jean. As such, Bell does not change throughout the novel—the change has already taken place, in response to Chigurh. But each monologue reveals more details and provides more insight into Bell. By the end of the novel, a much fuller picture of the man has developed. 

Bell underwent a formative experience when he was in his early twenties serving in Europe during World War II. When the farmhouse in which his squad was hiding was mortared by German soldiers, Bell initially returned fire but then ran away to save his own life. Though in reality, he couldn’t have helped his fellow soldiers, Bell is haunted by his actions. He dedicates the rest of his life to making up for what he considers to be cowardly and disloyal behavior. He even becomes a sheriff, like his grandfather, to have a job in which he can protect people. 

The realization that people like Chigurh walk free forces Bell to admit to himself that he can’t save everyone. Chigurh also solidifies Bell’s belief that the world is turning toward violence, lawlessness, and corruption, all of which oppose Bell’s ideals. Certain that he can’t keep the bad people away from the people he is sworn to protect and unable to keep up with changing times, Bell turns away from the life of law enforcement that has defined his adult life.
