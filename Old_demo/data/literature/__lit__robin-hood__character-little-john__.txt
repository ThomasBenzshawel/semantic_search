Little John is Robin Hood’s most trusted companion and right-hand man. Unlike Robin Hood, who sees no life more satisfying than the one he leads in Sherwood Forest, Little John is often tempted by a life of hedonistic pleasures. This weakness is why he ends up in the Sheriff’s service for a time, as well as why he often gets off course from his various errands and adventures to stop at a pub for a drink. However, Little John’s loyalty to Robin Hood is proved time and again as he resists these temptations to return to Robin under any circumstances. Little John is often the first to answer the call of Robin Hood’s horn, and his presence as Robin dies shows the lasting love the two friends feel for each other.

In the earlier stories, Little John does not have as well-developed an internal moral compass as Robin Hood does. For example, he steals the silver from the Sheriff as he escapes from his service, a theft that Robin considers unjustified because the Sheriff did nothing to deserve it. However, spending more time with Robin Hood does lead Little John to become motivated by a desire to help those less fortunate. Also, like Robin, Little John feels disdain for members of the clergy, often going out of his way to humiliate or steal from the bishops and friars he comes across. These actions show that Little John is also a morally ambiguous and at times hypocritical character, though he often tries his best to do what is right.
