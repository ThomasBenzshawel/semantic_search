Christian and Hopeful reach the Delectable Mountains on
					the outskirts of the Celestial City. They bathe and eat in the gardens
					and orchards that they discover in the foothills of the mountains,
					which belong to the Lord Emmanuel. They meet some kind shepherds
					who welcome them and say that the lord gave them the charge of offering protection
					to good pilgrims. The shepherds invite them to sleep.

The next morning the shepherds warn Christian and Hopeful
					of the nearby hills called Error and Caution, which lead some travelers to
					disaster. The remains of pilgrims, who have made false assumptions
					about the nature of resurrection, litter the ground beneath Error.
					Similarly, on the hill of Caution, blind travelers wander among
					tombs and get stuck there. Both these views show Christian and Hopeful
					what to avoid. They ask how the blind pilgrims came to wander among
					the tombs. The shepherds inform them that they tried to take a shortcut
					to the Mountains, which led instead to the Doubting Castle, where
					Giant Despair imprisoned them, put out their eyes, and left them
					to wander on the grounds of his estate.

The shepherds allow Christian and Hopeful to look through
					a telescope at the Celestial City. Christian and Hopeful tremble
					with so much excitement that they can hardly see through the glass.
					The shepherds bid them farewell, give them directions to the Delectable Mountains,
					and warn them not to sleep on the Enchanted Ground and to beware
					of someone named Flatterer. The narrator wakes up from his dream.

The narrator resumes his dream and sees Christian and
					Hopeful go on into the Delectable Mountains toward the Celestial
					City. They meet Ignorance, a lively lad who accompanies them for
					a while. Ignorance goes through life hoping for the best. He believes
					a good life is enough to enter heaven and tells Christian and Hopeful
					that their path to the Celestial City is unnecessarily long and
					difficult. He knows of an easier route. Christian tells Hopeful
					in a whisper that he considers Ignorance a fool. They outpace Ignorance
					and leave him when they turn into a dark alley full of devils.

In the alley they see a man bound with his face turned
					away. Christian recalls him as an old acquaintance named Little-Faith
					and tells Hopeful his story. Little-Faith was traveling with his
					birthright, a precious jewel, as well as some money. Set upon by
					thieves, Little-Faith loses most of his cash and is forced to beg
					for the remainder of his journey, which he complains about ceaselessly.
					He still has his jewel in his possession but hardly thinks of it.
					Hopeful asks why Little-Faith did not pawn his jewel for travel
					money. Christian reproaches him for foolishness, explaining that
					no believer can sell his faith for material comfort.

Christian and Hopeful follow Flatterer, a deceitful man
					in a white robe who speaks beautifully but ensnares them in a net.
					A Shining One arrives and cuts them loose. They meet Atheist, who laughs
					at their intention to reach the Celestial City. Atheist claims not
					to have found the Celestial City in twenty years of searching. The
					pilgrims affirm they have seen it.

Traveling onward, Christian and Hopeful discuss sin at
					great length. In part their discussion helps them ward off the sleepiness that
					comes from crossing the Enchanted Land. They ask whether any person
					is free from sin and agree that only Christ has been sinless. Christian
					asks Hopeful how he came to realize he was a sinner, and Hopeful
					tells of his realization. On the Enchanted Ground they fight off
					dangerous sleep. Seeing Ignorance again, they ask him why he lags
					behind, suspecting that this pilgrim does not like their company.
					They discuss Ignorance’s belief that good living alone guarantees
					salvation. Christian asserts that salvation comes through revelation,
					not through a good life alone. They also discuss reasons for backsliding
					among the devout. Ignorance insults revelation, calling it nonsense
					and affirming that a natural faith in God is enough to sustain a
					believer. Ignorance says he cannot walk as fast as Christian and
					Hopeful and falls behind.

Christian and Hopeful’s experiences at the Delectable
					Mountains emphasize the importance of reflection. When Christian
					and Hopeful gaze out at the other pilgrims wandering on Giant Despair’s lands,
					they recall one of their own experiences from the outside and see
					how it is lived by other pilgrims. By looking back on their previous
					experience, Christian and Hopeful realize how far they have traveled
					and just how close they are to the Celestial City. Christian also
					does not long for his previous life in the City of Destruction when
					he watches the pilgrims, but he sees how he has progressed since
					leaving and feels no regret. No longer does Christian just wander
					hoping he’ll reach the Celestial City. When Christian reaches the Delectable
					Mountains, he is firmly planted in Christ’s domain and has physical
					confirmation of his progress.

Ignorance’s appearance emphasizes the idea that spiritual progress
					requires more than simply living a good life and having a natural
					faith in God. Progress can only be made when movement is combined
					with knowledge and understanding. Ignorance is a likeable pilgrim.
					He is friendly to his fellow pilgrims, he loves and fears God as
					he should, and his good intentions cannot be doubted. But Ignorance
					is only walking toward salvation, not progressing toward it.
					He cannot make progress like Christian because he has not received
					revelation, nor does he believe in its value or express any interest
					in hearing about it. He thinks the received word of God is nonsense,
					and so his travel is only in the body, not in the mind or soul.

The division between the Eighth and Ninth Stages, in which
					the narrator’s dream is interrupted, demonstrates the visionary
					nature of the story. This happens at a few moments in The
						Pilgrim’s Progress. In terms of mere storytelling alone,
					such interruptions seem pointless and unnecessary. After all, the
					narrator does nothing when he wakes up but immediately go back to
					sleep and start to dream again, picking up at the exact point where
					he left off before. The reader might question why the narrator told
					the reader he woke up. But from another angle the dream interruptions
					are important. They reinforce the reader’s awareness that none of
					the story is real in any worldly sense. Christian is not an actual
					physical human but a figment of a dreamer’s imagination. By insisting
					on the dreamy or visionary aspect of his story, Bunyan reminds the
					reader that his story consists of spiritual material.

The importance of storytelling as a spiritual aid is also
					communicated by Christian’s story about Little-Faith. The content
					of that tale is not particularly new because it reinforces that
					a pilgrim may lose worldly comfort but still possess the jewel of
					faith that cannot be lost. This point has been made before in the
					book when Christian loses his certificate and then recovers it.
					The real interest in Christian’s tale lies in the fact that Christian
					himself becomes a storyteller like the narrator. Telling that tale,
					as the narrator of The Pilgrim’s Progress tells
					his own tale, Christian is able to engage his audience, who asks
					questions and learns. Moreover, Christian tells a story about another
					pilgrim, so his storytelling is in some way about his own pilgrimage,
					just as Bunyan the Christian tells a tale about a man named Christian.

The spiritual value of vision is reinforced by the most
					incredible vision yet to occur in The Pilgrim’s Progress:
					Christian and Hopeful’s glimpse of the Celestial City through the
					shepherds’ telescope. Here again, words and vision go hand-in-hand.
					The glorious destination that has been talked of throughout the
					book is finally seen. This visualizing of words is what Bunyan achieved
					in his writing: he has taken the word of God and tried to make it
					a real visionary experience, so that a believer could look through
					the lens of his story and see the Celestial City. But however much
					Bunyan may aid the viewer, in the end the vision is up to each person
					to glimpse. The detail of Christian’s hands trembling so much that
					he can hardly see the city reinforces the notion that the seeker
					controls his or her own vision.
