Blond, dreamy, and honorable, Ashley Wilkes is the foil
				to Rhett’s dark, realistic opportunism. Ashley courts Scarlett but
				marries Melanie Hamilton, thus setting in motion Scarlett’s central
				conflict. Ashley is the perfect prewar Southern gentleman: he excels
				at hunting and riding, takes pleasure in the arts, and comes from
				an excellent family.

	Scarlett’s idealization of Ashley slowly fades as time
				goes on, and she finally sees that the Ashley she loves is not a
				real man but a man embellished and adorned by her imagination. Ashley
				admits to his love for Scarlett, but as a gentleman he ignores this
				love in order to marry Melanie, the more socially appropriate match
				for him. He excels at battle despite his doubts about the Southern
				cause. As the novel progresses, though, Ashley displays signs of
				weakness and incompetence. After the war he is worthless on the
				plantation and cannot adjust to the new world. Whereas Rhett and
				Scarlett survive by sacrificing their commitment to tradition, Ashley
				cannot or will not allow himself to thrive in a changed society.
				He sinks even lower as he sacrifices his honor—the only thing he
				still values in himself—by accepting charity from Scarlett in the
				form of a share in her mill and by kissing her twice. 

	Ashley represents the Old South and Southern nostalgia
				for the prewar days. He epitomizes the old lifestyle and cannot
				function in the New South that emerges during and after the war.
				Scarlett clings to him like many Southerners cling to dreams of
				their old lives, but her eventual recognition of Ashley’s weakness
				and incompetence enables her to see that dreaming of a lost world
				makes one weak.
