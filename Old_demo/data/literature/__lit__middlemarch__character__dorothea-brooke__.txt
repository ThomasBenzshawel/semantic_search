Dorothea is an exceptional woman: she is smart, pious,
				and beautiful, and the governing principle of her character is her
				desire to help the needy, seen in her interest in redesigning the
				local farmers’ cottages. By giving money to Lydgate’s hospital,
				she is able to help the less fortunate, and by giving money directly
				Lydgate, she frees him from his debt to Bulstrode. Her philanthropic
				impulse indicates her essential goodness.

Dorothea is also stubborn and strong-willed, going against
				common advice to wed Casaubon, a much older man. Her marriage to him
				is driven by her desire to be taught by him, and she devotes herself
				to him entirely—and is appropriately devastated when he dies. Unfortunately,
				Casaubon doesn’t trust her unmitigated devotion, either to his work
				or in loving him. When Dorothea learns of a clause in his will that
				forbids her to marry his cousin Will Ladislaw, Dorothea’s devotion
				to her deceased husband shifts. She feels betrayed by his insinuation
				that she was unfaithful. In response, Dorothea refuses to finish
				Casaubon’s work, an indication that she is returning to her independent,
				pre-marriage self. When Dorothea does marry Ladislaw, she reveals
				her growth as a person. This marriage is a mutual understanding
				and partnership, and both members are equals. This marriage required
				Dorothea to flout convention and forgo her inherited wealth, and
				her willingness to do so show that she has regained her earlier
				rebellious energy but with a newfound maturity.
