The dozens of stories in The Arabian Nights, gathered over the centuries from India, Persia, and Arabia, were originally an oral tradition with specific authors unknown. Narrated by Shahrazad, the kingâ€™s new wife, the tales are her lifeline. If the king loses interest, he will put her to death. The stories include fables, fairy tales, romances, comedies, and histories, woven into a tapestry that has lasted for centuries, enlightening readers about the life and customs of the ancient Islamic world. The entertaining and often lewd and violent tales juxtapose prose and verse, realism and the supernatural, wealth and poverty, animals and masters, cruelty and kindness, and crimes and punishments.
