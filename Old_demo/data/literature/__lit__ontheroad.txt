On the Road, published in 1957, is a novel by American author Jack Kerouac that follows the cross-country adventures of Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty, two young men who reject societal norms and seek meaning and self-discovery through travel. Set against the backdrop of the 1950s, the novel explores the restless pursuit of freedom and self-discovery as the characters engage in a series of spontaneous, often hedonistic adventures. On the Road is a defining work of the Beat Generation, a literary movement that emerged in the 1950s and rejected the materialism and conformity of post-World War II America.Â
