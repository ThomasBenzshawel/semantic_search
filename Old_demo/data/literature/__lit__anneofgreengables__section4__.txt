Marilla fumes as she looks out the window and sees Anne
					talking to Matthew forty-five minutes after she was supposed to
					go inside and do chores. Marilla’s anger diminishes as Anne bursts
					into the room and joyfully describes the Sunday school picnic planned
					for the following week. She cannot wait to attend and to have her
					first taste of ice cream. When Marilla agrees to let her attend
					and says she will bake a basket of food for Anne to take along,
					Anne flies into her arms and kisses her cheek. Marilla flushes with
					warmth, though she disguises her pleasure with an injunction to
					Anne to be more obedient. Anne talks excitedly about her adventures
					with Diana and especially about their playhouse in the woods, which
					is composed of discarded pieces of board and china. 

When Marilla tries to hush Anne and quell her excitement
					about the upcoming picnic, Anne replies that she would rather look
					forward to things and risk disappointment than follow advice from stodgy
					ladies like Mrs. Rachel who say, “Blessed are they who expect nothing
					for they shall not be disappointed.” Anne says she was disappointed
					when she finally saw a diamond because it was not half as beautiful
					as she had imagined. She envisioned that a diamond was as colorful
					as the best amethyst, a stone that pleases both Anne and Marilla.
					Marilla has an amethyst brooch, her most prized possession, which
					she wears to church. Anne loves it so much that she begs Marilla
					to let her hold it for a minute.

Two days before the picnic, Marilla notices that her brooch
					is missing. She asks Anne if she touched it, and Anne admits that
					while Marilla was out for the afternoon, she saw it in Marilla’s
					room and tried it on just for a moment. Marilla, after searching
					her room thoroughly, realizes that Anne must have lost the brooch.
					Anne denies she lost it, steadfastly maintaining that she put it
					back. Marilla, however, cannot reconcile Anne’s story with the fact
					that the brooch is nowhere to be found, and she sends Anne to her
					room, declaring that she must stay there until she confesses.

	On the day of the picnic, Anne decides to confess. In
					poetic, theatrical language, she explains that she borrowed the
					brooch so that she could imagine she was Lady Cordelia and then
					accidentally dropped it into the Lake of Shining Waters. Marilla
					is furious that Anne lied and that she seems to feel no remorse.
					She orders Anne to stay in her room and tells her she cannot attend
					the picnic—a sentence Anne thinks unjust, since Marilla promised
					she could leave her room once she confessed. Anne throws a fit.
					Matthew suggests that Marilla is being a bit harsh, but he cannot
					think of a good defense for Anne.

	Marilla, trying to busy herself with chores, goes to
					fetch a black shawl that needs mending. When she picks it up, she
					catches sight of the brooch hanging from a thread. Realizing she
					was at fault the whole time and that Anne was telling the truth
					when she said she didn’t lose it, Marilla goes to Anne to apologize.
					She feels sorry for treating Anne as she did and has to squelch
					a desire to laugh at Anne’s invented confession. She scolds Anne
					for confessing to a deed she did not commit but admits she forced
					Anne to lie. Anne goes to her picnic and comes home overjoyed, telling
					stories about her adventures and about the indescribable taste of
					ice cream.

Anne and Diana take the most scenic route to school every
					day, walking on roads Anne has renamed Lover’s Lane and Willowmere and
					Violet Vale. Anne is thrilled to have a bosom friend in Diana and is
					willing to overlook Diana’s average imagination. Because Anne loves
					Diana so much, she lets Diana call a place the Birch Path, even though
					the name lacks Anne’s spark of originality. Marilla had worried
					that Anne’s temper, talkativeness, and oddities would cause her trouble
					at school, but Anne turns out to be a smart pupil and quickly adjusts.
					The other girls include her in their potluck lunches and exchange
					of small gifts. Anne dislikes boys and does not like the idea of
					flirting with them, though she is humiliated by the thought that boys
					are unlikely to flirt with her.

	Anne’s world expands from the quiet life at Green Gables
					to the bustling gossipy schoolroom at Avonlea. Her usual chatter
					to Marilla about flowers and nature changes to reports on school.
					The teacher, Mr. Phillips, pays little attention to the pupils in
					his one-room school and lets them run amok as he sits in the back
					row flirting with the oldest student, Prissy Andrews. Prissy is
					sixteen and studying for her entrance exam to college.

	Though Anne has received little schooling previously
					and is consequently one reading level behind her peers, she is quickly
					recognized as the smartest in the class. She takes pride in her
					intelligence, although she says she would rather be beautiful than
					smart. As Diana and Anne walk to school one day, Diana warns Anne
					she should not take for granted her status as smartest pupil, since
					Gilbert Blythe, the handsomest and smartest boy at school, will
					soon return to class. When she sees Gilbert, Anne agrees that he
					is handsome. But, unlike all the other girls, she is uninterested
					in him. Intrigued by the new girl who refuses to look at him, Gilbert
					tries to get her attention. He reaches across the aisle and whispers
					“Carrots,” as he tweaks her braid. Anne’s quick temper flares, and
					she jumps up, yelling at him and smashing a slate over his head.

	Mr. Phillips, busy flirting with Prissy, ignores Gilbert’s
					attempt to take the blame, refuses to listen to Anne’s side of the
					story, and punishes her by making her stand in front of the class
					for the rest of the day. Several times, Gilbert tries to apologize
					and make peace with Anne, but she ignores him each time. The next
					day, Mr. Phillips decides to make an example of pupils who return
					to school late after the lunch break. The boys and Anne, who is
					daydreaming alone, arrive late. Rather than go through the trouble
					of punishing all the latecomers, Mr. Phillips picks Anne out of
					the crowd and makes her sit next to Gilbert Blythe, a punishment
					Anne thinks unfair and humiliating. At the end of the day, Anne
					packs up her desk and solemnly tells Diana that sitting next to
					Gilbert was excruciating and that she will never return to school.

	Anne goes home and tells Marilla she will not go back
					to school. Marilla sympathizes with Anne. She goes to Mrs. Rachel
					for advice and decides that she will let Anne stay at home until
					she wants to return to school.

One beautiful October morning, Marilla announces that
					she will be away for the day and says that Anne should assume responsibility for
					running the house. She adds that Anne may invite Diana over for tea,
					leaving specific instructions about what Anne can serve Diana. During
					their tea, the girls, clad in their second-best dresses, act ladylike
					and proper, inquiring after each other’s health and families until Anne
					suggests they go outside and pick apples, at which point they resume
					their normal girlish familiarity. 

When the girls return inside for tea, Diana accepts a
					cup of raspberry cordial, a drink reserved for special occasions
					that Marilla has given the girls permission to drink that day. As
					Diana drinks a second glass and then a third, Anne tells stories
					about her ineptness in the kitchen. One time, she forgot to put
					flour in a cake. Another time, she neglected to cover plum-pudding
					sauce with a cloth, which she was using as a white veil. The next
					day, she found a mouse drowned in the sauce; she had planned to
					tell Marilla, but then got lost in another daydream. Two very stylish
					people came to tea, and just as Marilla was about to serve the plum
					pudding and sauce, Anne remembered her mistake and shouted out the
					whole mouse story, much to Marilla’s embarrassment. When Anne finishes
					her story, Diana stands up unsteadily and announces she does not
					feel well and must leave. Anne presses her to stay, but Diana insists
					on stumbling home.

	Two days later, Anne hears from Mrs. Rachel that Diana
					was not sick but drunk. Marilla realizes that Anne mistook the bottle
					of red currant wine for raspberry cordial and accidentally gave
					Diana alcohol. Mrs. Barry is furious, assuming that Anne intentionally intoxicated
					Diana. When Marilla goes to explain to Mrs. Barry that Anne made
					an innocent mistake, she is met with a stony countenance and harsh
					words. Mrs. Barry will not forgive Anne and has ordered Diana never
					to speak to Anne again. Anne begs Mrs. Barry to soften her sentence,
					but Mrs. Barry is resolute. Anne despairs at the prospect of being
					separated from Diana forever.

The schoolroom at Avonlea absorbs Anne and becomes the
					focus of her world. For the first time, Anne befriends many children
					her age. Instead of talking to plants or her reflection, as she
					did in the orphan asylum, she find people with whom she can interact.
					Although she has not had any practice socializing with peers, she
					manages to learn quickly the rules and manners of the social world.
					Similarly, her lack of formal education does not prevent her from
					absorbing the rules of reading, writing, and mathematics. As Anne
					tries to make sense of the new rules, she has some difficulty reconciling
					them with her own code of behavior. For example, Diana and all the
					other girls are accustomed to Gilbert Blythe’s barbs and have grown
					to enjoy attention from him. Anne, a stranger to such friendly teasing,
					is offended and enraged when he calls her “Carrots.” Unfamiliar
					with the ways in which young people interact with each other, she
					cannot understand that Gilbert’s comment is not meant to be an insult
					but is rather just an instance of teasing.

	As Anne’s social world changes, the content of her communication
					changes. Before, she talks to Marilla about nature and her imagination,
					but now she cannot stop talking about school events and friends.
					Her absorption in the minutiae of the girls’ social events reveals
					that, despite her eccentricities, Anne is not fundamentally different
					from the other girls her age. Her quick assimilation into the society
					of the schoolhouse suggests the power of peers to influence behavior,
					as well as the human ability to learn rapidly and conform to cultural
					norms.

	The schoolroom replicates the adult world. The girls
					gossip as Mrs. Rachel does, for example, and their play mimics adult
					behavior. At tea, Anne and Diana act ladylike in imitation of their
					elders. Montgomery illustrates the danger of mimicking adult behavior with
					the episode of Diana’s drunkenness. Although Marilla and Mrs. Barry
					constantly prepare their girls to act like proper adults, when the
					girls make an innocent mistake in the process of trying to act grown
					up, the adults punish them.

	Marilla continues to change and become a better parent.
					Just as Anne has to apologize earlier for lashing out at Mrs. Rachel,
					in these chapters Marilla learns to apologize for her mistaken assumptions. She
					feels bad about forcing Anne to lie and admits to her own mistake.
					Marilla becomes increasingly effective at managing Anne’s stubbornness
					and hot temper. When Anne comes home from school set on never returning,
					Marilla agrees to let her stay home. This leniency is new to Marilla,
					a product of her growing understanding of Anne and the mellowing
					effect that Anne has on her.
