Survival in Auschwitz is the U.S. title of If This Is a Man, Italian Jewish writer Primo Levi’s memoir that was first published in 1947. It describes his arrest as a member of the anti-fascist resistance in Italy during World War II and his incarceration in the Auschwitz concentration camp from February 1944 until the camp’s liberation in January 1945. Levi’s documents not only the resilience of the individual in the face of tyranny, but also provide a clear account of one of humanity’s most atrocious chapters.
