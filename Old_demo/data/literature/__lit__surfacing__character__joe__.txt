At first, the narrator depicts Joe as simple-minded and agreeable, but as
				Surfacing progresses, Joe’s personality undergoes changes.
				Where once he seemed content, he becomes irritable and sullen when the narrator
				refuses his marriage proposal. Also, Joe’s actions become less predictable. His
				proposal is unexpected, and the narrator becomes less able to discern Joe’s
				intentions. When David asks Anna to be filmed naked and Joe defends her, the
				narrator has trouble discerning whether Joe is helping a friend or seeking a way
				to become sexually aroused. The narrator shows herself to be unreliable in
				depicting Joe objectively. For example, she keeps bracing herself for a hit from
				Joe that never comes.

As her impressions of Joe fluctuate, the narrator’s impression of their
				love also shifts. Initially, the narrator downplays Joe’s love for her. She
				believes that Joe wants to marry her out of a conceptual ideal and not out of
				affection. The narrator also downplays her love for Joe, claiming she only
				enjoys Joe for his physical qualities. However, Surfacing ends
				with legitimate love between the two, and Joe displays his sincere affection for
				the narrator when he searches for her on the island. Despite this love, the
				narrator filters Joe’s actions through her own biases, making his true character
				unknowable.
