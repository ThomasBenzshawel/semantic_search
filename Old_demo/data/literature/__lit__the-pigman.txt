The Pigman, published in 1968, is a work of young adult fiction by playwright and writer Paul Zindel. The novel gained a wide audience when it debuted, partly because it was one of the first young adult novels to present an authentic portrayal of teenagers who skipped school, smoked, drank, and disliked their parents. A winner of numerous awards, The Pigman has maintained popularity with succeeding generations of readers. While this book has often been assigned in classrooms, it has also been banned for its depiction of underage smoking and drinking. The Pigman is part of “The Pigman Trilogy” along with The Pigman’s Legacy (1981) and The Pigman & Me (1992), the latter being an autobiography of Zindel’s encounter with his own “Pigman.”
