Judy Blume’s 1975 novel Forever explores the thrills and risks of a teenage couple’s first sexual relationship. Recognizing that most novels about teenage sexuality at the time focused on scare tactics and worst-case scenarios, Blume wrote Forever for her daughter to serve as a model of what a healthy teenage sex life could be. Because the young adult genre didn’t yet exist, booksellers weren’t sure how to classify Forever. Blume added a foreword in the 30th-anniversary edition. A romance novel with sex education, Forever is one of the most consistently banned and challenged books in the United States.
