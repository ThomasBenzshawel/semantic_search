Oko Sekyi is at once a sympathetic and an abhorrent character in the
				novel. He loves his wife Esi dearly, not only for her beauty but also for her
				independence and intelligence. But at the same time, Oko resents her for exactly
				the same reasons. He is bothered by the comments made by his friends, who are
				beginning to regard him as less and less of a man because of his wife’s
				independence from him. Oko’s response to his friends’ ridicule is to rape his
				wife—an act that leads directly to Esi’s decision to divorce him, given that he
				does not even apologize. Like all of the characters in the novel, Oko is
				struggling to understand his relationships in a changing world. Following his
				divorce, Oko’s mother presents him with a gift: a young girl who can play the
				role of a compliant and obedient wife. Even though there may very well be some
				appeal to such a relationship, Oko continues to love his strong-willed
				ex-wife.
