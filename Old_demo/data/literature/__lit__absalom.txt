Absalom, Absalom! is a Southern Gothic novel by William Faulkner, first published in 1936. The novel is a story within a story: it is narrated nonlinearly, in flashbacks, by Quentin Compson to his Harvard roommate, Shreve, and is about Thomas Sutpen, a poor white man who rises to wealth and power in the antebellum South, only to see his family destroyed by his own pride and ambition. The narrator, Quentin, is a main character in another Faulkner novel, The Sound and the Fury (1929). Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949.
