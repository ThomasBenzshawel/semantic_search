Lisa is the most powerful personality on the ward. Her
				utter disregard for authority makes her a frustrating and entertaining
				figure in the eyes of the other girls. Whether engaging in complicated
				pranks or escaping from the hospital, Lisa ensures that the routine
				of the ward never goes uninterrupted for long. Lisa is proud of
				her diagnosis as a sociopath and revels in the attention her antics
				earn her. Lisa is a dangerously attractive figure for the other
				girls, and the dark side of her personality can appear without warning.
				Lisa veers from extravagantly kind to perversely cruel. Kaysen meets
				Lisa some years after their time at McLean and is shocked to see
				her old friend dressed as a suburban mother, child in tow. In the
				course of their conversation, however, it becomes clear that Lisa’s
				personality is as unpredictable as ever; her new life can’t conceal
				Lisa’s impulsiveness and volatility.
