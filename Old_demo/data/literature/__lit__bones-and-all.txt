Combining elements of romance, science fiction, and horror, the macabre novel follows sixteen-year-old Maren Yearly, who is an “eater”—or in other words, someone who suffers from a compulsive and uncontrollable desire to eat human flesh. After being abandoned by her mother, Maren embarks on a journey of self-discovery that introduces her to other “eaters'' living on the periphery of American society. Told from Maren’s perspective, the novel explores the complicated nature of family, the ethical consequences of our choices, and the possibility of forgiveness.
