He had been to touch the great death,
						and found that, after all, it was but the great death.

The officers order a full-scale charge upon the
					fence, and the men comply with a final burst of energy. Bearing
					the flag as he runs through the smoke, Henry perceives dimly that
					many of the enemy soldiers are fleeing from the fence at the sight
					of the blue charge. Only a small, determined group remains. As the
					men battle, Henry sees that the enemy’s standard bearer is wounded.
					Thinking that capturing the opponent’s battle flag—that “craved
					treasure of mythology”—would be a supreme accomplishment, he rushes
					toward him. He and Wilson lunge for the flag at the same time, and
					Wilson succeeds in prying it from the dying enemy’s fingers. At
					last the gray soldiers are driven from the fence, and Henry’s regiment
					begins to celebrate. They have even taken four prisoners—one curses
					the regiment, one talks to them with interest, one stares stoically
					into space, and the last seems ashamed to have been captured. Henry
					nestles into a long patch of grass and rests contentedly, chatting
					with Wilson about their achievements.

After a while, the regiment receives orders to march back
					toward the river. As Henry walks, he ponders his experience of war
					and reproaches himself for his early behavior. His mind undergoes
					a “subtle change” as he feels elated about his recent success in
					battle, but is tormented by his cowardice in the first battle and
					reprehensible abandonment of the tattered man. Milling over both
					his accomplishments and his failures, Henry is finally able to put
					his life into proper perspective, to “criticize [these deeds] with
					some correctness.” At last, he is able to distance himself from
					the guilt that he feels about his initially selfish behavior. As
					a pouring rain begins to fall from the sky, Henry smiles, imagining
					a world of beauty, happiness, and eternal peace. He feels a “quiet
					manhood” within himself, and over the river a symbolic ray of sun
					breaks through the clouds.

The final, climactic charge that culminates in Chapter
					XXIII cements an important fact: Henry, whether by an act of courage
					or simply by following the momentum of his environment, has now proven
					himself to be an experienced and successful soldier. Along with
					the other surviving members of the regiment, he has earned the title
					and perspective of a veteran fighter. Crane portrays these soldiers
					as exhibiting epic heroism: after having almost been defeated, and
					with numbers dwindling, these remaining men resolve themselves to
					their goal and rally courageously to overcome the enemy.

The description of the actual charge focuses on the desperate, ludicrous
					futility of the action: “[Henry] did not see anything excepting
					the mist of smoke gashed by the little knives of fire, but he knew
					that in it lay the aged fence of a vanished farmer protecting the snuggled
					bodies of the gray men.” That the men endure such catastrophe simply
					to seize a line of fence is simultaneously appalling, inspiring,
					and grotesquely comical.

No section of The Red Badge of Courage has
					raised as much analytical debate as its ending. Many critics of
					the novel, especially in its early years, argued that Crane’s portrayal
					of Henry’s coming-of-age process is without irony, so that the closing
					lines regarding Henry’s new appreciation for life, his newfound
					security in himself, and his new sense of manhood are meant to be
					taken at face value: Henry gains perspective on his life and grows
					up. Other critics of the novel, particularly in recent years, have
					noted strands of sarcasm in Crane’s closing. They argue that the
					reader is meant to believe that Henry has simply fallen back on
					his old habit of covering up his psychological wounds with self-justification
					and delusion. According to this view, Henry is still the vain, uncertain
					boy he is at the beginning of the novel, despite his experience
					and success in battle.

The truth probably lies somewhere in between these interpretations.
					In light of the sardonic tone that pervades much of the novel, it
					seems simplistic to take the somewhat melodramatic, optimistic conclusion
					on its own terms. One can argue that Henry’s remarkable transformation
					is not realistic, given the brief period of time over which it occurs.
					On the other hand, there is reason to believe that Henry has matured.
					Although his new maturity seems in part a function of his vanity—Henry
					wants to believe that he has matured—he is also
					far less plagued by self-doubt and self-importance at the end of
					the novel than he is at the beginning. In all likelihood, Crane
					did not intend the reader to believe that Henry has simply transcended
					all of his shortcomings; he is still prone to fall back on illusion
					and vanity, and to shield himself from the crushing indifference
					of the universe to his existence. However, he is also more experienced,
					more confident, and more knowledgeable about himself. In this way,
					the optimistic tone of the end of the novel is convincing, even
					if the reader does not entirely share Henry’s conviction that he
					has conquered “the red sickness of battle” and fully adapted himself
					to the blunt, cruel realities of the world.
