Vandara represents and enacts the day-to-day control the villagers exert on one another, separate from the official governance of the Council of Guardians. Both types of control are obstacles on Kira’s journey of discovery, but the softer control that Vandara represents is less concrete than the Council’s well-defined list of rules and customs. She embodies the worst instincts and habits of the villagers as a group. For example, the villagers do not value tykes in general, and Vandara is suspected of having murdered one of her own children with poison. Vandara’s promoting of the lie about beasts is also representative of how the villagers prop up the Council’s control of the village, whether or not this is intentional. Vandara has very little characterization of her own beyond her cruelty and her role as an antagonist to Kira, but it is Vandara’s vendetta against Kira and Katrina that leads Kira to be housed in the Edifice, where she is set up to become a prominent artist in the community. When Kira is not punished like Vandara had hoped, Vandara takes the Council’s decision as a personal loss.
