Ron is tested and forced to evolve in this book in a way
				that Hermione is not. His abandonment of Harry and Hermione in the
				forest is an act that we really don’t expect from him, and in order
				for us to forgive him and accept his return, we need to see, as
				with Harry, the visible proof of what his struggle really is.

Part of the reason for Ron’s departure (aside from the
				negative influence of the Horcrux, which only exacerbates problems
				that are already there) seems to be simple immaturity. Ron has always
				been well fed, both at home and at school, and is quite greedy about
				food. When they’re on their own, he expects Hermione to feed him
				and take care of him, showing that he’s still basically a child.
				The same dynamic applies to the quest. Ron is brave and loyal enough
				when he’s along for the ride on one of Harry’s adventures, but the
				idea that Harry doesn’t know what he’s doing makes him very uncomfortable,
				because Ron needs to be told what to do.

When Ron comes back, however, and we see his fears manifested by
				the Horcrux before Ron destroys it, we see that his problem runs deeper.
				Always playing second fiddle to Harry, Ron does not believe that
				he could actually be loved—not by his girlfriend, not even by his
				own mother. When he accepts that he is loved, he
				is able to grow up and take responsibility for his part in the quest,
				no longer needing others to prove their love by coddling him.
