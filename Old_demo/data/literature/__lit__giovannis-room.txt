Giovanni’s Room is a novel by American writer James Baldwin that focuses on the events in the life of an American man living in Paris who struggles with his sexual identity. Published in 1956, the novel is notable for approaching topics of homosexuality and bisexuality with empathy and care at a time when these discussions were generally taboo in society. Readers and critics were surprised by Baldwin’s decisions to both use white characters and to tell a story of this nature. His publisher at the time suggested that he burn the book because its themes would in effect alienate him from his Black American audience. The novel explores themes of identity, desire, and the destructive power of societal norms.Today, Giovanni’s Room is regarded by many as Baldwin’s most beloved work.
