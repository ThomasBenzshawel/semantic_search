Through the Looking-Glass is a novel by Lewis Carroll that was first published in 1871. It is the sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Dodgson, who was a mathematician and logician at Christ Church, Oxford. Like Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, pokes fun at the vaunted rationality of the educated Victorian elite throughout the story. The whimsical humor of the Alice novels is drawn from a conflict between the rational ideal and the chaotic truth of the world.
