Stephen Kumalo is the protagonist and moral compass of Cry,
					the Beloved Country. He is a quiet, humble man, with a
				strong faith in God and a clear sense of right and wrong. An Anglican
				priest, Kumalo cares for his parishioners and presides over the
				modest church of the village he calls home. By village standards,
				Kumalo and his wife are middle-class, living in a house with several
				rooms. They struggle, however, to save money for their son’s schooling
				and for a new stove. Kumalo is not flawless, and he occasionally
				erupts in anger and tells lies. Praying to God, however, saves him
				from temptation, and he always repents when he speaks unfairly.

As the novel begins, Kumalo undertakes his first journey
				to the city of Johannesburg. He is intimidated and overwhelmed by
				the city, betraying his simple background. With the help of generous hosts,
				however, he is able to put his fear aside and search with determination
				for his son. As the search drags on, we become aware of Kumalo’s
				physical weaknesses—according to African tradition, he has reached
				the time in his life when his children should be caring for him.
				He is forced instead to search for his son. When it becomes clear
				that Absalom is in grave trouble, Kumalo’s body is further broken
				by his grief. His faith wavers, too, but he seeks the help of friends
				in the ministry, who support him and pray with him. By the time
				Kumalo leaves Johannesburg, he is deeply sad, but his faith is buoyed
				by the generosity of others. When he returns to his village, Kumalo
				works to improve the lives of his parishioners. In the end, he faces
				his son’s death with mourning, but also with a sense of peace.
