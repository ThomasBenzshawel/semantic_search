Zora Neale Hurston’s short story “Sweat” was first published in 1926 in the Harlem Renaissance literary journal Fire!!. Like Hurston’s classic 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, “Sweat” takes place in a small Black community in Florida and tells the story of a woman overcoming an abusive marriage. The story, largely written in dialect, showcases Hurston’s unique position as both a native of a similar Florida town and a trained anthropologist, specializing in African American and Caribbean folktales. Despite her work having fallen into obscurity for decades, Hurston is revered today as a giant of the Harlem Renaissance and American fiction writing.
