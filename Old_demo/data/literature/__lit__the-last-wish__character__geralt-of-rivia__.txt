An enigmatic and dauntless figure, Geralt is the protagonist of The Last Wish and The Witcher series. He challenges the idea of what it means to be a hero, and through him, the audience comes to understand certain truths about the world in which he lives: evil is pervasive, monsters must be stopped, and not everything is as it seems. Geralt’s life is defined by his role as a witcher, a person who can destroy monsters. The process that transformed him into a witcher made him into something not entirely human, which often leads him to troubling gray areas where he must personally judge the line between human and monster.  

Geralt is clever, well-learned, and adept at conversation. Though he’s something of a lone wolf for much of the book, he understands people and situations very thoroughly, and other characters comment that they feel uncomfortable when he observes them. He is often able to talk himself out of (or into) trouble and uses that gift to resolve problems. Geralt is typically reserved and serious, but he is more affable and good-natured with those close to him. Nenneke, Dandelion, and Yennefer are all important to him, and he relates to each of them in a different way. Though he has numerous acquaintances, he has few other connections in the world that he treats with the same measure of loyalty and care as the three of them.
