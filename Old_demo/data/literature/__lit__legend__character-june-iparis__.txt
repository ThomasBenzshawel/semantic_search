June is the Republic’s prodigy. She is the only person known to have scored a perfect 1500 on the Trial. The kids around school treat June like a star, which flatters her because she’s cocky and likes attention. Inside, however, June feels alienated from her peers. Her abilities put her at a distance from them. Back home June has only her brother and dog for company. She believes in her government and is proud to be on the way to becoming one of its prized members. Even her tastes in music and art are in line with the Republic—the “Elector’s Waltz” is one of her favorite songs. 

June values logic and can remain level-headed in any situation, like a true soldier. When Commander Jameson asks her to analyze the scene of her brother’s murder, June maintains a stoic face and carries out her orders. Like Day, however, June has a rebellious streak, but mostly because she is bored and isn’t being challenged enough, not because she is against the Republic. Also, like Day, she values family above all. When June’s brother, Metias, dies, she vows to avenge his death. June learns that satisfying one’s feelings of revenge, however, can backfire and lead to more destruction than resolution. When she ignores all signs of Day’s innocence and leads him into a trap to betray him, she truly feels heavy guilt. The guilt June feels springs from a sense of compassion that allows her to see through the Republic’s propaganda and the truth behind Day and her brother’s death. Through Day, June finds an equal and a friend to forge a real relationship with and create a new life beyond the Republic.
