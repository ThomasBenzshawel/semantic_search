Martin acts as both foil and counterpart to Pangloss.
				He is more believable than the other major characters in the novel,
				not because he is more complex, but because he is more intelligent
				and more likely to draw conclusions with which we can identify.
				A scholar who has suffered personal and financial setbacks, Martin
				is as extreme a pessimist as Pangloss is an optimist. He even takes
				issue with Candide’s statement that “there is some good” in the
				world. Direct experience plays a greater part in Martin’s estimation
				of the world than it does in Pangloss’s. As a result, he is able
				to provide insight into events far beyond Pangloss’s ability to
				do so. Martin demonstrates such insight when he predicts that Giroflée
				and Paquette will not be happier for having money and when he analyzes
				the psychology of Count Pococurante.

	Though Martin’s philosophy is more effective and honest
				than Pangloss’s, it also has some of the same flaws. While Martin
				is usually good at predicting how people will behave, he fails noticeably with
				Cacambo. Martin’s absolute pessimism dictates that a valet trusted
				with millions in gold will certainly betray his master, yet Cacambo’s
				honesty defies that pessimism. Voltaire prefers flexible philosophies
				based on real evidence to dogmatic assertions based on abstractions.
				Absolute optimism and absolute pessimism both fall into the latter
				category, because they will admit no exceptions. Like Pangloss,
				Martin abides by ideas that discourage any active efforts to change
				the world for the better. If, as Martin asserts, “man [is] bound
				to live either in convulsions of misery or in the lethargy of boredom,”
				why should anyone try to rescue anyone else from “convulsions of
				misery”?
