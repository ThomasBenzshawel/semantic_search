To Jurgis the packers had been equivalent
						to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were . . . a gigantic combination
						of capital.

After the meeting ends, Jurgis finds the speaker resting
					amid a crowd of people. He asks for more information about the party,
					and the speaker directs him to Ostrinski, a socialist who speaks
					Lithuanian. Ostrinski takes Jurgis to his home. They share
					their experiences in scraping out a miserable existence. Ostrinski
					explains that wage-earners have nothing but their labor to sell.
					None of them can obtain a price for it that is higher than what
					the most desperate worker will take.

Ostrinski explains that there are two economic classes:
					the small, privileged capitalist class and the large, impoverished
					proletariat. Because the capitalists are few in number, they can
					easily work together in favor of their own interests. The proletariat,
					on the other hand, is large and generally ignorant. Ostrinski explains
					that workers need to gain “class consciousness” so that they can
					organize in favor of their interests. In this way, they can avoid
					the merciless wage competition. Ostrinski calls the current system
					“wage slavery.” Although America claims to be the land of the free,
					Ostrinski explains that political freedom doesn’t alleviate the
					grinding misery of wage slavery. He adds that socialism is necessarily
					a worldwide movement: any one nation that achieves success will
					be crushed by the others around it. Ostrinski calls socialism the
					“new religion” of humanity. He adds that it could also be interpreted
					as the fulfillment of Christian values on Earth.

Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism.
					She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the
					family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with
					him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small
					hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs
					Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer
					for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds
					is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never
					tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists
					flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor
					does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to
					detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with
					the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages.

Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion.
					He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to
						Reason, and learn all about the political and economic
					systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when
					he cannot sway people to socialism.

Jurgis attempts to persuade Marija to leave prostitution,
					but she explains that she cannot because she is addicted to morphine.
					She plans to remain a prostitute for the rest of her life.

Jurgis attends a meeting with a magazine editor who opposes socialism
					but has agreed to listen to some proponents of the movement. Jurgis’s
					role is to detail the unsanitary conditions under which meat is
					packed and sold to the public. Nicholas Schliemann, a fierce socialist,
					explains that the movement wishes to enact public ownership of the
					means of production. Once the inefficiency of production is eliminated
					through science and eradication of graft, no worker will be obliged
					to labor for countless hours a day merely to survive. He can work
					as little as two hours a day and devote the rest of his time to
					his personal interests.

The basic goals of socialism are “common ownership and
					democratic management of the means of producing the necessities
					of life.” The means to bring about this revolution is to raise the
					class consciousness of the proletariat around the world
					through political organization. Later, the socialist party achieves
					phenomenal victories in the elections across the country. A spirited
					speaker at a political meeting urges socialists to continue fighting
					because the victory is not yet won, encouraging them with the words,
					“Chicago will be ours!”

The final chapters of The Jungle largely
					abandon the narrative, functioning as an explanation and an argument
					for socialism. Insofar as they tell a story, it is the story of
					Jurgis’s process of conversion to socialism. The newly introduced
					Ostrinski and Schliemann are less dramatic characters than mouthpieces
					for socialism. The ending of The Jungle is, to
					a great extent, meant to be simplistic. Sinclair’s aim, after all,
					is not to present the complicated nuances of actual political
					and economic practices but to persuade the reader to adopt his opinions.
					The lack of literary sophistication in the ending is obvious, but
					it is also questionable whether the simplistic ending and the one-dimensional
					story in general make for the most persuasive political argument.
					One can argue that the credibility of the novel as reportage becomes
					doubtful as it begins to resemble propaganda. Sinclair closes his
					sharp eye for detail when he examines socialism, and the effect stunts
					the humanity of the people whom he wants to liberate.
					Ironically, the peoples’ movement seems devoid of real human beings.
					If Sinclair wants the reader to identify with his socialists, he
					fails because there is no real human being with whom to identify.
					Jurgis, a constricted character to begin with, almost disappears,
					and the new characters are flatter than any that Sinclair has offered
					so far.

The shift to pure propaganda in the final chapters occasions
					several awkward ruptures in the narrative perspective. Throughout The
						Jungle, Sinclair narrates events as seen through the eyes
					of Jurgis, though he sometimes employs a more omniscient perspective
					to describe business dealings and social problems that Jurgis doesn’t witness.
					In an attempt to weave these passages into the narrative fabric,
					Sinclair has Jurgis learn of them at some unspecified future point
					in time. As the volume of political argument increases in the final
					chapters, the interweaving of political commentary and narrative
					structure becomes more forced. Sinclair recounts that “after Jurgis
					had made himself more familiar with the Socialist literature, as
					he would very quickly, he would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from
					all sorts of aspects . . .”; a lengthy polemic against the Beef Trust
					then follows, as if it comprises the knowledge that Sinclair claims
					that Jurgis gains.

The meetings that Jurgis attends provide another forum
					for Sinclair to air his politics, as does the literature that Jurgis
					reads. These framing devices are sites of tension between Sinclair’s
					politics and the demands of literary composition. Sinclair wants
					to make his argument in as blunt a language as possible, but the
					work of fiction has its own laws of internal consistency. The journalistic
					style that Sinclair employs requires realism. Moreover, a narrative
					perspective that filters events and ideas through the experience
					of the protagonist must do so consistently or risk breaking apart.
					The framing devices show that Sinclair feels these demands. He knows
					that information about the Beef Trust cannot simply be inserted
					into the text; rather, its presence has to be justified in the narrative
					structure. Thus, Jurgis learns about the Beef Trust at some future,
					unspecified point, and Sinclair is free to rail against it.

One can argue again, however, that these framing devices
					are too cheap to be effective. They are usually a single sentence,
					an afterthought. Perhaps their real failure, though, lies in the
					fact that they do not control the information that follows. They
					claim that what follows is witnessed or learned by Jurgis, but Jurgis’s
					perspective disappears in the subsequent argument. The reader doesn’t
					learn how Jurgis, in particular, receives what he learns from socialist
					literature. Jurgis doesn’t filter events and information through
					his subjectivity; he is simply a conduit: “Such was the home in
					which Jurgis lived and worked. . . .” His character, one might argue,
					becomes not only flat but hollow.
