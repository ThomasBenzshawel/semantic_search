A twenty-five-year-old surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital
				in Hiroshima, Dr. Sasaki is hardworking, idealistic, and ambitious.
				We learn the extent of his selflessness early, when Hersey describes
				how he risks penalties by treating sick patients in the suburbs
				without a permit. As the only physician at the hospital who is unharmed
				in the explosion, he treats thousands of the dying and wounded people
				of Hiroshima. Dr. Sasaki contributes to important medical advances
				in the analysis and treatment of radiation sickness after the bombing, and
				for years he spends most of his time trying to remove keloids—the
				red, rubbery scars that grow over severe burns—only to discover that
				much of his work caused more damage than good. He later leaves the
				city to set up a private clinic,  distance himself from his gruesome
				memories, and make a clean start.

	We are kept at more of an emotional distance from Dr.
				Sasaki than from any other character. This distance emphasizes how
				Dr. Sasaki does not seek recognition or praise for his hard work.
				Thus, it is a bit shocking when he expresses his anger by saying
				that those responsible for the bomb should be hanged, but at the
				same time we see how he was deeply traumatized by his experiences
				after the bombing. While other characters attempt to simply continue
				on with their lives, Dr. Sasaki makes a break with the past by leaving the
				hospital. This drastic action suggests a deep level of suffering and
				a desperate need to forget what he experienced. Hersey illustrates
				Dr. Sasaki’s emotional disengagement from the bomb victims with
				a memorable turn of phrase: “He lived enclosed in the present tense.”
