No Country for Old Men, a novel by Cormac McCarthy published in 2005, focuses on a drug deal gone wrong. While the novel encompasses big themes that define the modern era, its words bring to life the man who stumbles across the scene, the sociopathic hitman who pursues him, and the sheriff who tries to save him. Playing out along the Texas-Mexico border, this novel returns to the setting of McCarthyâ€™s border trilogy (All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities on the Plain). Originally written as a screenplay, No Country for Old Men was the basis for the 2007 film of the same name by Ethan and Joel Coen that one multiple Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
