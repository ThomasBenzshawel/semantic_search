Simply because she is Jupiter’s wife, Juno is a key figure
				in the Metamorphoses. Unlike Jupiter, however,
				she does not make world-changing decisions or seek out extramarital
				relationships. Her less powerful role means that she does not drive
				the plot, as Jupiter does. Still, the brutal punishments she metes
				out are what give the poem much of its spice. She constantly catches
				her husband sleeping with other women. His exploits enrage her,
				and she vents her wrath on Jupiter’s lovers, revenging herself on
				Io, Callisto, Europa, and Semele, among others. She also torments
				the offspring, such as Ino, that these women have by Jupiter. Even
				those who impede Juno’s efforts to catch Jupiter, such as Echo,
				feel her wrath. Juno never takes revenge in a foolhardy or thoughtless
				way. She is always cunning and calculating. She may not be as powerful
				as her husband is, but Juno is an intelligent, fearsome goddess.
