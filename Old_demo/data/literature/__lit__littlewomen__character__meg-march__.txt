The oldest March sister, Meg battles her girlish weakness
				for luxury and money, and ends up marrying a poor man she loves.
				Meg represents the conventional and good; she is similar to her
				mother, for whom she was named. Meg sometimes tries to alter who
				she is in order to please other people, a trait that comes forth
				when she allows other girls to dress her up like a rich girl at
				her friend Annie Moffatâ€™s house. She becomes an agreeable housewife,
				pretending to like politics because her husband does, and forgoing
				luxury because her husband is poor.
