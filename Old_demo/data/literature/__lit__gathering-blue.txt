Lois Lowry’s Gathering Blue was published in 2000 as the follow-up to her Newbery Medal-winning novel, The Giver (1993). Gathering Blue is a dystopian young adult novel that tells the story of protagonist Kira’s search for knowledge in the face of deception and obfuscation in a closed, repressive society. The novel deals with themes of disability and difference, perseverance in the face of adversity, and the power of art to effect societal change. After Gathering Blue, Lowry published two more books to complete The Giver Quartet: Messenger (2004) and Son (2012).
