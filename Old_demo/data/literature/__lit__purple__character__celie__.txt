As a young girl, Celie is constantly subjected to abuse
				and told she is ugly. She decides therefore that she can best ensure
				her survival by making herself silent and invisible. Celie’s letters
				to God are her only outlet and means of self-expression. To Celie,
				God is a distant figure, who she doubts cares about her concerns. 

Celie does little to fight back against her stepfather,
				Alphonso. Later in life, when her husband, Mr. ______, abuses her,
				she reacts in a similarly passive manner. However, Celie latches
				on to Shug Avery, a beautiful and seemingly empowered woman, as
				a role model. After Shug moves into Celie and Mr. ______’s home,
				Celie has the opportunity to befriend the woman whom she loves and
				to learn, at last, how to fight back.

	Shug’s maternal prodding helps spur Celie’s development.
				Gradually, Celie recovers her own history, sexuality, spirituality,
				and voice. When Shug says Celie is “still a virgin” because she
				has never had a satisfying sex life, Shug demonstrates to Celie
				the renewing and empowering capacity of storytelling. Shug also
				opens Celie’s eyes to new ideas about religion, empowering Celie
				to believe in a nontraditional, non-patriarchal version of God. 

Nettie’s long-lost letters, which Celie discovers with
				Shug’s help hidden in Mr. ______’s trunk, fortify Celie’s sense
				of self by informing her of her personal history and of the fate
				of her children. As her letters show, Celie gradually gains the
				ability to synthesize her thoughts and feelings into a voice that
				is fully her own. Celie’s process of finding her own voice culminates
				with her enraged explosion at Mr. ______, in which she curses him
				for his years of abuse and abasement. Mr. ______ responds in his
				characteristic insulting manner, but his put-downs have no power
				once Celie possesses the sense of self-worth she previously lacked.

	The self-actualization Celie achieves transforms her
				into a happy, successful, independent woman. Celie takes the act
				of sewing, which is traditionally thought of as a mere chore for
				women who are confined to a domestic role, and turns it into an
				outlet for creative self-expression and a profitable business. After
				being voiceless for so many years, she is finally content, fulfilled,
				and self-suf-ficient. When Nettie, Olivia, and Adam return to Georgia
				from Africa, Celie’s circle of friends and family is finally reunited.
				Though Celie has endured many years of hardship, she says, “[D]on’t
				think us feel old at all. . . . Matter of fact, I think this the
				youngest us ever felt.”
