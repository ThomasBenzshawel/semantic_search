Although Mr. ______’s development is not the subject of
				the novel, he undergoes just as significant a transformation as
				Celie does. Mr. ______ initially treats Celie as no more than an
				object. He beats her like an animal and shows no human connection,
				even during sex. He also hides Nettie’s letters to Celie from Celie
				for years.

Mr. ______’s harsh treatment of Celie spurs her development. Celie’s
				discovery of Nettie’s letters begins her first experience with raw
				anger, which culminates in her angry denunciation of Mr. ______
				in front of the others at dinner. Celie’s newfound confidence, instilled
				in her by Shug, inspires her to react assertively and forcefully
				to Mr. ______’s abuse.

When Celie returns from Tennessee, she finds that Mr.
				______ has reevaluated his life and attempted to correct his earlier
				wrongs. Mr. ______ finally listens to Celie, and the two come to
				enjoy conversing and sewing together. Mr. ______ eventually expresses
				his wish to have an equal and mutually respectful marriage with
				Celie, but she declines.
