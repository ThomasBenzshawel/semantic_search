One afternoon, Anne spies Diana outside beckoning to her.
					Anne rushes out, and Diana tells her she is still forbidden to play
					with Anne so she has come to say goodbye. The two have a sentimental, melodramatic
					parting. When Diana cries that she loves her bosom friend, Anne
					says, “Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is
					. . . a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of
					a path severed from thee, Diana.” Anne asks for a lock of Diana’s black
					hair to keep as a memento. To combat her despair over losing Diana,
					Anne decides to return to school. There, she can look at Diana even
					though the two are forbidden to talk or play together. Anne’s classmates
					welcome her back with open arms and little gifts. Some of the girls
					send her plums, bottles, or copied poems, and two admiring boys,
					Charlie Sloane and Gilbert Blythe, pass her a slate pencil and an
					apple, respectively. Anne graciously accepts Charlie’s gift but
					ostentatiously ignores Gilbert’s offering. One day, to Anne’s dismay,
					she and Gilbert are tied as top student, and Mr. Phillips writes
					both of their names on the board.

A Canadian premier comes to Prince Edward Island to address
					a mass meeting in Charlottetown, about thirty miles from Avonlea. Mrs.
					Rachel loves political events, so she goes with her husband and Marilla.
					At home, Anne is studying, and Matthew is reading the Farmers’ Advocate
					when Diana rushes into the house and cries that her three-year-old
					sister Minnie May is sick with the croup, and neither she nor the
					babysitter know what to do. Matthew quickly harnesses the horse
					and goes for the doctor, while Anne and Diana rush back to the Barry
					house, Orchard Slope. Having cared for three sets of twins at Mrs.
					Hammond’s home who all got croup regularly, Anne knows how to care
					for Minnie May. Matthew arrives with the doctor at three A.M., by
					which time Minnie May is sleeping peacefully. 

Later, the doctor tells Mr. and Mrs. Barry that Anne saved
					their daughter’s life. Mrs. Barry comes to Green Gables the following
					day and apologizes for blaming Anne for the currant wine incident.
					She invites Anne to tea and encourages her to be friends with Diana
					once again. Anne is thrilled by the news and pleased that the Barrys
					treat her like special company at tea.

Anne explains to Marilla that in celebration of Diana’s
					birthday, Mrs. Barry has agreed to let Diana invite Anne to a Debating
					Club concert and spend the night in the Barrys’ spare bedroom. Anne
					can hardly contain her excitement, but Marilla declares that she
					cannot go because little girls have no business at late-night concerts.
					Matthew disagrees with Marilla’s decision and tells her so until
					she relents and gives Anne permission to go. On the day of the concert, Anne
					and Diana take pleasure in everything from getting dressed to riding
					Diana’s cousins’ pung sleigh to listening to scholars recite poetry
					and sing at the concert. After the concert, they return to the Barrys’
					house. They change into their nightgowns, and Anne proposes that
					they race to the spare bedroom. The girls charge in and leap onto
					the bed, landing right on Diana’s crotchety aunt, Miss Josephine
					Barry, who arrived for her visit unexpectedly early.

	Anne is disappointed at having to sleep with the toddler,
					Minnie May, rather than in the spare bedroom, but the following
					day returns to Green Gables happy and satisfied. Later, Mrs. Rachel reports
					that the Barry house has been in an uproar all afternoon. Aunt Josephine,
					angered at being awoken in the middle of the night, has decided
					to cut short her visit and rescind her offer to pay for Diana’s
					music lessons. She is a rich old lady, used to being treated decorously,
					and will not listen to Diana’s pleas. Anne wants to remedy the situation
					since she, not Diana, proposed the race into the spare bedroom.
					She goes to the Barry house and enters the old lady’s room, terrified
					but bold, and begins to confess. The old lady is amused by Anne’s
					elevated way of speaking. She agrees to give Diana her music lessons
					and stay the full month at Avonlea, under the condition that Anne
					talk to her at the Barrys’ and then visit her in town.

Spring returns to Green Gables, bringing Anne’s favorite
					ornaments of nature—flowers. She tells Marilla stories about exploring
					nature with her school friends. On the day of her anniversary of
					arriving at Green Gables, Anne takes considerable care with her
					chores. Marilla leaves Anne in charge of the house because of a
					headache. In the evening, Marilla asks Anne to go to Mrs. Barry
					to get an apron pattern. Anne asks Marilla if she may delay the
					trip until morning. She explains that she and Diana, tired of their
					commonplace surroundings, have begun to pretend that the woods between
					their houses are haunted. But Marilla, always trying to rid Anne
					of the nonsense in her head, sends her on the errand. Anne returns
					from the Barrys’ house out of breath from running and trembling
					with fear.

The anniversary of Anne’s arrival at Green Gables corresponds
					with signs of Anne’s development as a young woman and a full member of
					Avonlea society. Anne digests her old experiences and uses them to
					improve herself, a process central to a child’s development into adolescence
					and adulthood. In an instance of Anne’s increasing maturity, she
					manages for the first time to make a heartfelt, effective apology.
					In contrast to her overblown apologies to Mrs. Rachel and Marilla
					in past chapters, Anne’s apology to Aunt Josephine, in Chapter 19,
					is delicate, sincere, and immediately successful. She has learned
					to curb her temper and put her eloquence to good use.

Anne applies old lessons to new situations not only when
					making apologies but also when saving Minnie May. Although Anne
					disliked caring for Mrs. Hammond’s twins, she is able to use the knowledge
					she gained in the Hammond household to save Minnie May’s life. Previously,
					Anne’s unorthodox background and unusual behavior have made her
					the town laughingstock, but in these chapters respectable people
					like the doctor compliment her for learning from the unusual experiences
					of her past.

	Anne and Gilbert’s rivalry grows increasingly heated.
					Anne is “as intense in her hatreds as in her loves,” an intensity
					apparent in her enduring hatred for Gilbert. She will not even speak
					Gilbert’s name, as if trying to deny his existence altogether. When
					Mr. Phillips writes their names on the board in Chapter 17,
					the image of Anne’s name underneath that of her enemy suggests both
					a flirtation between the two of them and her failure to best him
					in school, and Anne cringes at the sight. However, just as Anne’s
					unorthodox manner of speaking wins her the approval of Aunt Josephine,
					her unusual talent for holding a grudge works in her favor in some
					respects. Because she loathes Gilbert and wants to triumph over
					him, she works harder in school than she otherwise might, even given
					her natural love of learning.

Anne displays her fanciful and unshakable imagination
					yet again in pretending with Diana that the woods between their
					houses are haunted. There is nothing scary about these woods, but
					Anne simply decides that she wants them to evoke a particular emotional reaction.
					Because she believes so strongly in this fantasy, she actually alters
					her perception of reality. Though she herself has created the idea
					that the woods are scary, she nevertheless comes home nervous with
					fright. This ability to get lost in fantasy and think creatively
					about the world differentiates Anne from Marilla, who initially
					cannot even fathom that Anne could be useful at Green Gables.
