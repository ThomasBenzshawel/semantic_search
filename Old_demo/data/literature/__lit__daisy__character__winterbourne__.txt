An American who has lived most of his life in Europe,
				Winterbourne is the type of Europeanized expatriate that Mrs. Costello
				and Mrs. Walker also represent. He is also closely associated with
				New England Puritanism: he makes his home in Geneva, “the dark old
				city at the other end of the lake” that James is at pains to identify
				as the wellspring of Calvinism, not out of necessity but by choice.
				In many ways, Winterbourne is as central a character as Daisy and
				may very well be the story’s true protagonist. Certainly, he is
				the novel’s central consciousness, the character through whose eyes
				we see and experience everything. 

Early on, we are told that Winterbourne is “addicted to
				observing and analyzing” feminine beauty. However, he does not appear
				to be a very deep or discriminating thinker. He spends time with
				his aunt not because of affection or because he takes pleasure in
				her company, but because he has been taught that “one must always
				be attentive to one’s aunt.” Winterbourne seems to hold in high
				regard what Mrs. Costello tells him, about the Millers as much as
				anything else. Out loud he defends Daisy, albeit rather feebly,
				but the whole novel is, in a sense, the story of Winterbourne’s
				attempts and inability to define Daisy in clear moral terms. Winterbourne
				is preoccupied with analyzing Daisy’s character. He wants to be
				able to define and categorize her, pin her down to some known class
				of woman that he understands. Daisy is a novelty to him. Her candor and
				spontaneity charm him, but he is also mystified by her lack of concern
				for the social niceties and the rules of propriety that have been
				laid down by centuries of European civilization and adopted by the
				American community in Rome. He befriends Daisy and tries to save
				her but ultimately decides that she is morally beyond redemption.
