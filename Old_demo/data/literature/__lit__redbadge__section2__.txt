The next morning, the soldiers learn that Jim was mistaken:
					the army does not move. Henry continues to worry about his courage, and
					watches his comrades for any sign that they share his self-doubt. One
					day, the army is given orders and begins to march. While marching,
					the soldiers debate when and if they will see battle. Henry keeps
					to himself, too preoccupied with his own speculations to join the
					other men. The regiment enjoys itself, and is wildly amused when
					a fat soldier attempts to steal a horse but the young girl who owns
					it stops him. At night, the men set up camp, and Henry, feeling “vast
					pity for himself,” asks Wilson if he can imagine himself running
					from battle. Wilson indignantly claims that he would do his part
					in a battle and leaves Henry feeling even more alone.

The next night finds the increasingly exhausted
					soldiers marching through a dark forest. Henry worries that the
					enemy might appear at any moment. When the enemy fails to materialize, Henry
					returns to thinking that his regiment is nothing more than a “blue
					demonstration.” One morning, however, Jim shakes Henry awake. They
					hear the crack of distant gunfire, and the regiment begins to run.
					Boxed in by his fellow soldiers as the officers goad them toward
					the battle, Henry realizes that even if he wanted to run, the throng
					of surrounding soldiers would trample him. Pressed forward, the
					regiment parts to move around the body of a dead soldier. As he
					passes the corpse, Henry grows increasingly vulnerable, and curses
					the commanding officers who, it seems, are leading them to certain
					death. 

The men stop several times, many using branches and stones
					to build protective trenches which they must abandon as the march drives
					them forward. The more the regiment moves, the faster the soldiers’
					morale wanes. They gradually begin to think that their leaders are
					incompetent and indecisive. As the fighting draws closer and the
					sound of gunfire grows louder, Wilson tells Henry that he believes
					he will die in the battle. He gives Henry a yellow envelope and
					asks him to deliver it to his family, should he not make it home.

The regiment stops in a grove with the chaos of battle
					raging around them. The regiment’s lieutenant is shot in the hand.
					The soldiers of the 304th take their place
					on the line, and veteran soldiers who mock their inexperience surround
					them. As a group of enemy soldiers thunders toward them, Henry and
					his regiment load their weapons and prepare to engage. Miserably,
					Henry remains convinced that when he has to confront the worst that
					war has to offer, he might distinguish himself not by how bravely
					he fights, but by how quickly he runs away.

The self-doubt awakened in Henry in Chapter I continues
					to plague him as he draws closer to battle in Chapter II. He oscillates
					between grand, dramatic fantasies of the “traditional courage” that
					leads to glory in the field and an innocent belief that the army
					is never going to fight—that his regiment, rendered impotent by
					Christian education, constitutes merely a “blue demonstration.”
					Henry’s experiences eventually shatter these preconceptions. His
					development into a man who understands that courage, duty, and manhood
					are complicated and sometimes compromised is the most compelling
					aspect of The Red Badge of Courage.

Even at this early stage, there are excellent opportunities
					to scrutinize Henry’s conflicted character. He is incredibly vain,
					obsesses over his own feelings, and seems unwilling to differentiate
					between moral behavior and behavior that simply wins him the envy
					and praise of others. In other words, he is less concerned with duty than with glory. He
					fears being exposed as a coward, not because cowardice marks a shirking
					of his responsibilities as a soldier, but because such exposure
					would deny him an illustrious reputation. After all, Henry’s desire
					for a noble name prompts his enlistment in the first place—he feels
					little obligation to earn the title of hero. Rather, the “lavish
					expenditure” of food, smiles, and compliments that he meets on the
					way to Washington proves to be enough to make him believe that he
					deserves such rewards.

As the novel progresses, Henry comes to the painful realization of
					his own insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe—as his mother
					tells him in Chapter I, he is “jest one little feller amongst a hull
					lot of others.” When the marching troops come across a corpse, Henry
					feels “the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer
					to the Question.” “The Question” is never articulated, but the answer,
					which Henry moves closer and closer to learning, has much to do
					with understanding the modest and fragile proportions of one’s life
					and the meaning of honor. Crane uses passing moments such as Henry’s
					memory of his mother’s advice and this first encounter with a dead
					soldier to plant some of the novel’s larger ideas in the reader’s
					mind. The narrative’s major thematic concerns, such as the irresolvable
					tensions between self-preservation and the impetus to behave honorably,
					begin to be defined.
