Grandmother Majauszkiene, a wizened old Lithuanian neighbor, explains
					to the family that houses such as the one they have taken are a
					swindle. She and her son were lucky enough to make the payments
					long enough to own the house but most people are never able to do
					so. She explains that the houses are more than fifteen years old and
					that they were built with the cheapest, shoddiest materials. No one
					is able to buy the houses because, for the Packingtown workers, missing
					even one month’s payment means eviction and the forfeiture of everything
					paid on it. The family is shocked to learn that they have to pay
					interest on their debt, bringing the actual monthly payment close
					to twenty dollars.

Grandmother Majauszkiene came to Packingtown when the work
					force was mostly German. The Irish took the Germans’ place, and
					now the Slovaks have taken the place of the Irish. The companies
					grind down and wear out successive generations of immigrant workers.
					Four families tried to buy the home that Ona, Jurgis, and their
					family now live in. One by one, each failed due to the death of a
					key wage earner through accident or illness.

By paying ten dollars to the forelady, Ona obtains a job
					sewing covers on hams in a cellar. The young Stanislovas lies about
					his age and obtains a job working a lard-canning machine.

Ona and Jurgis’s veselija has
					put them over a hundred dollars in debt. Illness strikes the family
					frequently due to the unsanitary conditions of Packingtown, but
					no one can take a day off work to recover.

Winter brings bitter cold and impassable snow drifts.
					The companies don’t provide adequate heating at work. There
					is a wave of death in Packingtown as the bad weather and disease
					claims the weakened, the hungry, and the old, including Dede Antanas.
					Thousands wait to take the vacant places in the plants. Many men
					succumb to the allure of whiskey and beer and become alcoholics.
					Jurgis resists these temptations because he is determined to shield
					Ona and their family from the tortures of homelessness and starvation.

Tamoszius, a musician, begins to court Marija. His fiddle-playing brings
					a note of cheer into the family’s life. He is also a popular guest at
					various celebrations because he is a musician. He invites Marija to
					most of them; if the hosts are his friends, he invites the entire
					family. These celebrations aid the family in surviving
					the relentless monotony of toil and poverty. Tamoszius proposes
					to Marija and she accepts. They plan to finish the attic in the
					house and use it for their room.

Marija’s canning factory shuts down and she loses her
					job. During the winter, after the rush season, many factories close
					down and many workers lose their jobs. Even Jurgis suffers from
					a cut-back on the hours at his job. Workers receive no pay for partial
					hours. The wage earners in the family all join unions. Jurgis begins
					to recruit other Lithuanians for the union with a zealous fervor,
					often frustrated by their ignorance and indifference. Their optimism
					and naïve commitment to the American Dream remind him of the misguided
					views he held when he first arrived in America.

Jurgis attends union meetings religiously and
					resolves to learn English by attending night school and having the
					children help him. Jurgis becomes a U.S. citizen at the urging
					of a man at his plant. He does everything that the man says and
					follows him to the voting booths and marks the ballot how the man
					tells him to. For his trouble, Jurgis receives two dollars. Only
					later does he learn what the entire process means when his fellow
					union members explain to him that he has been exploited in one of
					the many vote-buying schemes in the country.

Jurgis learns the folklore of Packingtown. He learns of
					the graft, corruption, and greed spread by the likes of Mike Scully,
					a local Irish politician. He hears of the physical injuries and
					disease that ravage the labor force. He comes to realize that the
					dishonest meat companies sell diseased meat and label cans as “deviled
					ham” or “potted ham” although the contents are a mixture of leftover
					bits and entrails from any number of slaughtered animals.

The family’s encounter with Grandmother Majauszkiene foreshadows
					these immigrants’ eventual fate. The real-estate companies have trapped
					them in a scheme by selling them a house that is shiny and pretty
					on the outside but rotten on the inside. In this way, the
					house is similar to the tins containing rotten and diseased meats—like
					these meat products, the house is sold on its appearance. This ruse
					also exemplifies the betrayal of the American Dream by capitalism. The
					home is the symbolic center of the family, and owning one’s own
					home is a central tenet of the American Dream. The real-estate company’s
					swindling of Jurgis and his family suggests that the capitalism
					that makes the American Dream possible also, paradoxically, destroys
					it.

Grandmother Majauszkiene has seen successive generations
					of immigrant laborers crowd into Packingtown where they are ground down
					and worn out. Those who survive enter the web of graft and corruption
					and, by doing so, advance in power and status, mostly by abusing
					the next generation of immigrants. The successive waves of wage
					laborers who come to Packingtown to face abuse and degradation recall
					the image of the animals being herded to slaughter in the stockyards.
					These immigrants either fail to succeed or they compromise their
					moral principles. Either way, as with the ill-fated animals, forces
					beyond their control determine their respective fates.

An important premise of the novel is that the political
					and governmental systems that support American capitalism are as
					rotten and corrupt as the business world itself. Sinclair makes
					clear that the few labor reform laws aimed at preventing abusive
					labor practices are largely ineffective. The child labor laws forbidding
					children under the age of sixteen to work do nothing to keep children
					from being forced to labor at grueling jobs, since the desperate
					need for money necessitates that these youths work any job that
					they can. The very structure of capitalist economics, in Sinclair’s
					portrayal, demands such a sacrifice in order for one to survive.
					Throughout The Jungle, Sinclair uses narrative
					incidents such as Stanislovas’s exploitation as evidence to support
					the argument that working from within capitalism is not effective.
					Socialism, he argues, is the only viable political and economic
					system.

Jurgis’s naturalization to become an American citizen,
					which might otherwise be seen as an encouraging step on his way
					toward achieving the American Dream, is tainted with corruption.
					The democratic process is entirely besmirched by politicians with
					hands caught in the deep pockets of big capitalists. Elections are
					rigged through an extensive vote-buying scheme, and members of the
					Chicago criminal underworld take advantage of ignorant, impoverished
					wage laborers to pervert the democratic process according to the
					wishes of big businessmen and their cronies.
