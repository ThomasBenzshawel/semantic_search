Melchizedek, who claims to be the King of Salem, appears to Santiago as an old
				man living in the Spanish town of Tarifa, and although he appears only briefly in
				the book, he plays an important role as he introduces several of the key concepts
				that we see repeated throughout The Alchemist. For example, he
				tells Santiago about Personal Legends, the Soul of the World, and Beginner’s Luck.
				He also gives Santiago two magical stones, Urim and Thummim, which represent “yes”
				and “no” respectively, to help guide him on his journey. Melchizedek is also the
				first character in The Alchemist to display magical powers. Those
				powers help him convince Santiago to pursue his dream of finding a treasure near the
				pyramids in Egypt.

By his own account, Melchizedek plays a role in the lives of everyone who
				pursues his or her Personal Legend. He essentially motivates people to continue
				pursuing their Personal Legends in times of doubt, as he does when he meets Santiago
				in the novel. Although he appears to Santiago as a flesh-and-blood man, he explains
				that he appears to people more often as a symbol or idea. Evidently he has been
				serving this purpose for a long time, as he remembers helping the biblical Abraham
				in his own journey. Even when Melchizedek is not physically present, the magical
				stones he gives Santiago help Santiago to remain hopeful and focused as he pursues
				his Personal Legend.
