There is a general consensus among scholars that 1 Corinthians
					was written by the important early Christian missionary Paul of
					Tarsus. In late 56 or early 57 a.d.,
					Paul was in the city of Ephesus in Asia Minor. From there, writing
					with his collaborator Sosthenes, he addressed a series of letters
					to the Greek city of Corinth, which he had visited between 50 and 52 a.d.,
					and where he had converted both Jews and Gentiles to the Christian
					faith. Corinth was located on the isthmus connecting the Peloponnesian
					peninsula to the Greek mainland, and its advantageous location allowed
					it to become a prosperous merchant city. Prosperity, however, brought
					pagan hedonism. Corinth developed a reputation, widespread throughout the
					ancient world, for sexual license. Paul’s letters to the Christians at
					Corinth address his concern over a pressing issue: the rampant immorality
					associated with the paganism of Corinth. This immorality had begun
					to infect the Corinthian church. Paul was deeply concerned for the
					spiritual health of the Corinthian church, which had been deprived
					of his guidance for several years. As a result, Paul corresponded
					at greater length with the Corinthian church than with any of the
					other communities that he established. The New Testament preserves
					two of these letters, 1 and 2 Corinthians,
					and makes reference to at least one other lost letter (1 Cor. 5:9).

Paul begins 1 Corinthians with
					a greeting to “the church of God that is in Corinth,” in which
					he offers thanks for the faith and strength of the Corinthian church
					(1:2). He immediately
					begins, however, to list and address the problems that plague that
					church. The first problem, to which he devotes almost four chapters,
					concerns factionalism within the church. Paul has heard that the
					Corinthian church has divided itself according to the various preachers
					of the Gospel: “each of you says, ‘I belong to Paul,’ or ‘I belong
					to Apollos,’ or ‘I belong to Cephas,’ or ‘I belong to Christ’” (1:12). Paul
					stresses that each preacher of the Gospel is merely a servant of Jesus,
					and that all believers should be united in Jesus. The faithful should
					put aside their differences and remember that “[a]ll things are
					yours. . . . You belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God” (3:23).
					The place of the preachers is not to establish themselves as leaders
					among men; instead, “[p]eople should think of us as servants of
					Christ” (4:1).

Paul enumerates various immoral tendencies of the Corinthian Christians.
					He cautions them to condemn sexual immorality within the church.
					Membership in the community of the faithful, he teaches, means that
					the church faithful must adjudicate moral matters amongst themselves,
					chastising and expelling sinners. In response to questions put to
					him about specific confusions over religious practice, Paul sets
					forth a principle that becomes embedded in church doctrine: “To
					the unmarried . . . I say: it is well for them to remain unmarried
					as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should
					marry” (7:8–9).
					Paul advocates freedom of conscience within the bounds of faith.
					He does not mandate circumcision, although many early Christians,
					who were practically all Jewish, assumed that circumcision was a
					prerequisite for conversion to Christianity. Paul declares it permissible
					to eat food dedicated to false gods, provided that one does not
					compromise the conscience of another Christian by doing so.

In a break from his instruction, Paul spends
					Chapter 9 discussing his own case. He sees
					himself as a man who has sacrificed everything to preach the Gospel,
					forgoing material comfort and becoming all things to all people.
					Returning to his moral instruction, Paul invokes the example of
					the ancient Israelites, who were punished for their immorality and
					faithlessness, and exhorts the Corinthians to avoid idolatrous worship
					and sexual immorality. He explains to them that while it is not
					forbidden to eat certain foods, it is best to avoid offending people
					and to respect the consciences of others. Paul then speaks on public
					worship. He says that women must cover their heads during prayer,
					while men must pray with heads bared. When the Lord’s Supper is
					commemorated, it must be celebrated in true communal fashion, and must
					be preceded by careful self-inspection.

In Chapters 12 and 14,
					Paul speaks of the regulation of spiritual gifts in the church of
					believers. There are many instances in the Corinthian church of
					people prophesying and speaking in tongues. These spiritual gifts
					are important because they help to strengthen the community. All
					gifts, and all believers, are indispensable to the church. Each
					believer is a part of the incarnated body of Jesus, and each fulfills
					his or her own particular function. But Paul prioritizes prophecy,
					with its clarity of message, over speaking in tongues, which is
					generally indecipherable and therefore cannot provide instruction
					to the community. Paul interrupts this discussion of spiritual gifts
					with Chapter 13, which has become known as
					the Hymn to Love, in which he expounds upon the importance of love:
					“And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest
					of these is love” (13:13).

Paul moves toward his conclusion with an exposition on
					the doctrinal question of the resurrection of the dead. He reminds
					the Corinthians of the core Christian doctrine. The resurrection
					of Jesus, he insists, is a cardinal point of the Christian faith.
					The future resurrection of all the dead stems from Jesus’s own resurrection,
					and it is the future resurrection—the promise of eternal life—that
					makes Christian sacrifice meaningful: “If the dead are not raised,
					Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (15:33).
					Paul explains the nature of resurrection, noting that the physical
					body will not be resurrected. Rather, it is the spiritual body that
					is immortal. The immortality of the spiritual body signifies the
					true victory of faith over death, and Paul concludes, “Thanks be
					to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ”
					(15:57). Finally, 1 Corinthians ends
					with Paul’s instruction to the Corinthians to take up a collection
					for the benefit of the poor in Jerusalem. He expresses his hope that
					he will be able to visit Corinth soon, and in the meanwhile urges the
					Corinthians to accept his emissary Timothy with open arms. He charges
					them to “[k]eep alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous,
					be strong. Let all that you do be done in love” (16:13–14).

In 1 Corinthians, through the issues
					that he chooses to address, Paul provides us with historical insight
					into the early Christian Church. It was a church without any single
					supreme authority. The missionaries and preachers who spread the
					Gospel in the decades after Jesus were by no means homogenous in
					their approaches to Christian doctrine and practice. Paul speaks
					of divisions in the church at Corinth that stem from perceived differences
					in the Gospel as preached by various missionaries. It seems that
					Paul, Apollos, and Cephas (the Aramaic name given to Peter) each
					had adherents in the Corinthian church. It is possible that the
					Christians at Corinth, recent converts who were inadequately instructed
					in Christianity, simply misunderstood the missionaries and believed
					doctrinal differences to exist. It is also possible that there were
					actual important differences between the Christianity of Peter and
					that of Paul. Instances of disagreements between early Christian
					leaders are both implicit and explicit in The New Testament. For
					instance, in Acts 15, it is evident that
					the apostles Peter and James are more conservative than Paul with
					regard to adhering to Jewish law. But it is also true that in Corinthians,
					Paul addresses a group of people with little knowledge of Paul’s
					Jewish culture. A certain amount of confusion was probably inevitable.

Paul’s letter is remarkable in that it exhorts the Corinthians toward
					unity rather than ideological division. He does not mandate resolving
					whatever differences may exist between the factions of the Corinthian
					church. Rather, he reminds them of the all-important unity that
					binds them and supersedes their differences. Throughout 1 Corinthians,
					the themes of unity and the importance of freedom of conscience
					within certain moral boundaries are constantly stressed. This freedom
					of conscience extends from doctrinal issues to questions of practice:
					for instance, Paul permits the Corinthians to eat food sacrificed
					to idols (10:26–27),
					in direct defiance of the principle established by the church leaders
					in Jerusalem (Acts 15:28–29). In
					his discussion of the various spiritual gifts granted to the faithful, Paul
					returns again to the theme of unity through diversity: “Now there
					are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of
					services, but the same Lord” (12:4–5).

Paul’s great commandment is to love. He hopes that love
					will bind the community together despite its differences, and lead
					people to achieve faith and godliness in anticipation of the imminent
					Second Coming. Paul attempts to unify the church by accepting varying beliefs
					and practices, but his emphasis on unity does not reflect any willingness
					to compromise his religious faith. Paul’s accepting attitude has
					limitations, and 1 Corinthians is filled
					with Paul’s righteous indignation. He does not hesitate to “say
					this to your shame” to the Corinthians, nor to chastise them for
					their moral misdeeds (15:34). In
					this letter, Paul assumes the voice of a stern but loving parent.
					He says, “In Christ Jesus I became your father” (4:15),
					and he tells the Corinthians, “I fed you with milk” (3:2).
					The family of believers is open to all who are faithful. Unlike
					many of the early Christians, Paul is willing to accept Gentile
					as well as Jew: “For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into
					one body . . . slaves or free” (12:13).
					But acceptance does not mean tolerance of repeated misdeeds and
					the refusal to repent: “Drive out the wicked person from among you”
					(5:13).
