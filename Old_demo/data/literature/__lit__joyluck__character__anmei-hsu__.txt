At an early age, An-mei Hsu learns lessons in
				stoic and severe love from her grandmother, Popo, and from her mother.
				Her mother also teaches her to swallow her tears, to conceal her
				pain, and to distrust others. Although An-mei later learns to speak
				up and assert herself, she fears that she has handed down a certain
				passivity to her daughter Rose.

An-mei sees “fate” as what one is “destined” to struggle
				toward achieving. When her youngest child Bing dies, An-mei ceases
				to express any outward faith in God, but retains her belief in the
				force of will. Rose initially believed that the death had caused
				her mother to lose faith altogether, but she eventually realizes
				that she may have misinterpreted her mother’s behaviors.
