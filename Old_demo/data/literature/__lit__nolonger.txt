No Longer at Ease, published in 1960, is a novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. It is the second book in Achebe’s African Trilogy, which also contains Things Fall Apart (1958) and Arrow of God (1964). The novel tells the story of Obi Okonkwo—a young Nigerian man who is the grandson of Okonkwo, the main character in Things Fall Apart. He returns to his country after studying in England, and struggles to navigate the corruption he encounters. Through Obi’s experiences, Achebe explores themes of cultural clash, the effects of colonialism, and the tension between tradition and progress.
