Introduced as a quiet and intense older boy, Roger eventually becomes a sadistic and brutal terrorist over the course of Lord of the Flies. Midway through the book, Roger’s cruelty begins to surface in an episode where he terrorizes the littlun Henry by throwing rocks at him. Still beholden to the rules of society, Roger leaves a safe distance between the rocks and the child, but we see his moral code beginning to crack. As Jack gains power, Roger quickly understands that Jack’s brutality and willingness to commit violence will make him a powerful and effective leader. When he learns that Jack plans to torture Wilfred for no apparent reason, he thinks about “the possibilities of irresponsible authority,” rather than trying to help Wilfred or find out Jack’s motivation. Roger gives into the “delirious abandonment” of senseless violence when he releases the boulder that kills Piggy. He then descends upon the twins, threatening to torture them. The next day, the twins Samneric tell Ralph, “You don’t know Roger. He’s a terror.”
