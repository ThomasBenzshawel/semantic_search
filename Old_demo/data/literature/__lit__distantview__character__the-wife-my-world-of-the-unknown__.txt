The narrator, the wife of a government official, never explicitly
				indicates that her marriage to her husband is unsatisfying, but because she is
				so easily seduced by the snake-spirit that inhabits their home, she reveals the
				extent of her unhappiness and dissatisfaction. The snake provides fulfillment in
				every capacity. She satisfies the narrator sexually, lavishes her with youth and
				vitality, and takes her to hidden spirit worlds. The adventure of the
				relationship completely eclipses her domestic life. However, the narrator is
				initially ambivalent about the snake. She is attracted to the snake, then she
				tells her husband to board up the house’s cracks so the snake can’t enter, then
				she yearns for the snake. Her request to her husband is significant. Though the
				snake is female, it has a phallic form, and it eventually replaces the
				husband in the role of sexual partner. When the wife asks her husband
				to help keep the snake out, she is making a final attempt to impel him
				to take action before she seeks sexual fulfillment in other ways. Later, when
				the wife stops up the cracks in the wall, it is in a playful, teasing way, which
				illustrates how she has changed from being fearful of her sexuality to embracing
				it.

In the narrator’s fantasy world of passionate sexual fulfillment,
				adventurous romping through other worlds, and love with a companion who is
				considerate and giving, we find the model of an ideal relationship—the only
				clear representation of an ideal relationship in all of Rifaat’s stories. Though
				the events are likely only products of the narrator’s imagination, it shows a
				true understanding of what characterizes fulfillment in marriage.
