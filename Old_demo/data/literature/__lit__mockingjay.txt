Mockingjay, by Suzanne Collins, is a 2010 young adult dystopian novel about government control and loss of individualism and is the third book in Collins's Hunger Games Trilogy—following The Hunger Games (2008) and Catching Fire (2009). Narrated by Katniss Everdeen, survivor of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay topped the bestseller lists when it was published in 2010. The three books were adapted into a highly successful film series of four films between 2012 and 2015, including a two-film treatment of Mockingjay in 2014 and 2015, in which Katniss is portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. In 2020 Collins published a prequel to the trilogy called The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.
