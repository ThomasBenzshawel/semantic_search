The narrator says that Tom-all-Alone’s is dark and menacing.
					In a sort of surreal meditation, he says that Tom is asleep, but
					that a lot of fuss has been made about him in Parliament, where
					people discuss how to get him off the street or what else to do
					with him. The narrator says that Tom gets revenge by contaminating
					everything around him.

Morning arrives. Mr. Woodcourt walks around Tom-all-Alone’s and
					sees a woman sitting on a stoop. He sees a bruise on her forehead
					and bandages it, then asks if her husband is a brickmaker because
					he believes brickmakers are violent. She says her husband will be
					looking for her. He asks if she has a baby, and she says no, although
					her friend Liz has one that she thinks of as her own.

Woodcourt moves on and soon sees a wretched young boy
					running toward him, whom he thinks he recognizes. A woman is running
					after the boy, yelling for someone to stop him. Woodcourt grabs
					him, thinking he has stolen the woman’s money. When the woman rushes
					up, she exclaims excitedly that she has finally found Jo. Jo admits
					that he once saw Woodcourt when he spoke about the dead lodger in
					front of the coroner. Woodcourt asks the woman if Jo robbed her,
					and she says no; rather, he has been very kind to her. She says
					that a woman took Jo home with her to care of him when he was sick,
					but that Jo ran away. She says that the woman then became sick herself
					and lost her beauty. Woodcourt is speechless.

When he recovers, he asks Jo why he left the house. Jo
					says he never knew a woman had been caring for him and that he would never
					have done anything to hurt her. He says someone took him away, but
					he won’t name the man, fearful that he’ll find out since he seems
					to be everywhere. Jo says this man gave him money and told him to
					“move on.” Woodcourt tells Jo he’ll find him a place to hide. Woodcourt
					and Jo set off.

Woodcourt and Jo stop for breakfast, and Woodcourt puts
					his hand on Jo’s chest, telling him to breathe. He can’t breathe
					easily. Jo then tells Woodcourt about his recent adventures, including
					the story about the woman in the veil whom he led to the graveyard.
					They approach Krook’s old shop. Miss Flite isn’t there anymore;
					Judy Smallweed tells him she now lives with a Mrs. Blinder in Bell
					Yard. Woodcourt and Jo find her, and she greets Woodcourt happily.
					She tells Woodcourt that Jo can hide with “General George,” and
					she leads them to George’s Shooting Gallery. Woodcourt tells George that
					Jo needs a place to hide, since he fears a man who seems to be everywhere.
					Woodcourt tells George that the man hunting for Jo is Inspector
					Bucket. George responds that Jo is welcome to stay with him and
					Phil. Woodcourt warns George that Jo is ill and may not get better.
					George introduces Jo to Phil, saying that Phil once lived on the
					street too. George tells Woodcourt that he is certain that Bucket took
					Jo to Tulkinghorn when he scuttled him away from Bleak House. George
					asserts that Tulkinghorn is a bad person.

Woodcourt visits Mr. Snagsby. Snagsby, uneasy, tells Woodcourt to
					speak quietly so that Mrs. Snagsby doesn’t hear them. Snagsby says
					that although he’s never had a secret, he’s always getting involved
					in other people’s secrets. He says that someone has instructed him
					not to talk about Jo. But he agrees to visit Jo.

Jo is happy to see Snagsby and asks him to write out the
					facts of what happened after Jo has moved on as far as he can go,
					so that other people know he never meant to cause any harm. Snagsby agrees.
					The narrator says that Snagsby and Jo will never meet again.

When Woodcourt visits Jo, Jo is worse. Woodcourt leads
					Jo in a prayer, and Jo soon dies.

The narrator says that the Dedlocks are in their London
					home, and that Lady Dedlock is, as usual, still much revered and
					the center of attention. Tulkinghorn doesn’t reveal her secret,
					and no one suspects he has any power over her. Meanwhile, Lady Dedlock
					has decided to disregard their agreement and take action of her
					own. She tells Rosa that it’s time for her to leave. Rosa is distraught,
					but Lady Dedlock has already arranged for Mr. Rouncewell to pick
					her up. She goes to tell Sir Leicester that she has dismissed Rosa;
					Tulkinghorn is with him, and she tells him to stay. When Mr. Rouncewell arrives,
					Lady Dedlock announces to him that she has decided Rosa must leave
					her. He agrees to take Rosa with him. Rosa comes in, upset, and
					Lady Dedlock coldly says goodbye to her.

Later, Tulkinghorn speaks to Lady Dedlock alone and tells
					her she has violated their agreement. He thinks getting rid of Rosa
					will raise suspicions. He says that Lady Dedlock’s secret is actually
					his secret, since he has taken it on to protect Sir Leicester and
					his family. Lady Dedlock says she wanted to protect Rosa. Tulkinghorn
					says he will now proceed of his own accord and that she will receive
					no other notice of what he will do. She asks him when he will tell
					Sir Leicester, but he won’t give her a specific answer. He leaves.

The narrator says that Lady Dedlock goes walking in the
					garden alone that night. Meanwhile, Tulkinghorn is at home. The
					narrator describes the nighttime scene, then suddenly asks, “What’s
					that?” A gunshot has been heard. The narrator says that Tulkinghorn
					doesn’t go to the window to investigate. He says that the painted
					Roman on the ceiling, which has always been pointing aimlessly,
					is now pointing at Tulkinghorn’s dead body—he has been shot through
					the heart.

The narrator describes Mrs. Bagnet’s birthday celebration.
					Mr. Bagnet prepares an elaborate dinner and tells Mrs. Bagnet that
					George will surely visit. She says she fears George may be about
					to resume his wandering ways, but Mr. Bagnet disagrees. At dinnertime, George
					arrives. He is pale and tells the Bagnets that the young boy he’d
					taken in has died. Later, Bucket arrives, saying he spotted George
					through the window. The Bagnets’ two daughters greet him excitedly,
					instantly enraptured with him. Mrs. Bagnet tells him that George
					is upset, but George won’t explain. Mrs. Bagnet asks if Bucket has
					a family; he has a wife but no children. Bucket suddenly compliments
					the Bagnets’ backyard and asks if there’s any way out of it; there
					isn’t.

The Bagnets’ son, Woolwich, entertains them with the fife. Bucket
					continues to be congenial and warm, livening up the evening immensely,
					and George begins to like him. When George eventually gets up to
					leave, Bucket gets up to leave with him. Before going, Bucket asks
					Mr. Bagnet the price of a violoncello and says he’ll return tomorrow
					to look at a few.

George and Bucket walk down the street with their arms
					linked. Suddenly, Bucket roughly pushes George into a public house
					and arrests him. George is flabbergasted. Bucket says he is arrested
					for the murder of Tulkinghorn, which happened last night. George
					is horrified to realize that he was there last night. Bucket says
					he knows George was often there, that they often quarreled, and
					that one time Tulkinghorn called George a “threatening, murderous, dangerous”
					man. Bucket says Sir Leicester is offering a reward to anyone who
					finds the murderer. He puts handcuffs on George and leads him away.

Esther gets a letter from Caddy, who now has a rather
					strange-looking baby and is in poor health. Caddy says that good
					things always happen to her when she’s with Esther. Esther begins
					visiting Caddy in London every day. Mr. Jarndyce says they should
					live in London for a while so that she can visit more easily. He
					suggests that Woodcourt become Caddy’s doctor, and Esther agrees.
					She finally tells Ada she’s going to marry Mr. Jarndyce.

Esther spends a great deal of time with Caddy, who insists
					to everyone that she is getting better even though she is very sick.
					She actually does begin to get better, however, when Woodcourt becomes
					her doctor. Esther sees Woodcourt very often and is certain that
					he still pities her.

She begins to notice a change in Ada and suspects that
					she’s upset about Esther’s plans to marry Mr. Jarndyce.

As Caddy recovers, Mr. Jarndyce talks to Esther about
					how wonderful Woodcourt is and how he wishes he could make Woodcourt rich.
					He speculates that Woodcourt may take another trip and suspects
					that Woodcourt has been disappointed in some way.

One night, Ada begins crying and tells Esther she doesn’t
					know how she can speak to her and Mr. Jarndyce. Esther, thinking
					this is because of their impending marriage, assures Ada of their
					affection for her and their happily planned future. She notices
					that Ada falls asleep with one hand under her pillow.

In Bleak House, Dickens gives his characters
					unusual names that evoke aspects of their personality or role in
					the novel. For example, Esther’s last name, Summerson, evokes images
					of warmth and happiness, both of which aptly describe Esther’s interactions
					with all those around her. Ada Clare is indeed “clear” in her affections
					for Richard Carstone, who, like his surname suggests, is stony and obstinate.
					Allan Woodcourt “would” indeed “court” Esther. Mr. Snagsby often
					finds himself getting “snagged” in other people’s messes. The “lock”
					in the Dedlock name suggests the secret that Lady Dedlock has kept
					for so long, and her little-referred-to first name, Honoria, suggests
					the core of goodness that exists despite her guilt over her past
					transgressions. Skimpole, as his name clearly denotes, “skimps”
					on money and gets it from others. Inspector Bucket is a repository
					of facts and knowledge, as a bucket is a repository of water. And
					little Jo is as insignificant in the larger world, just as his diminutive
					two-letter name would suggest. Other names are associated with sounds
					or rhyming words in an equally evocative manner. Tulkinghorn, for
					instance, evokes the sneaky word “skulk,” which Tulkinghorn indeed
					does as he gathers secrets. The “horn” of his name also suggests
					his desire or intention to reveal those secrets. Far from being
					cloying or pedantic, the names Dickens uses add texture and humor
					to the novel and reveal the close attention Dickens pays to every
					aspect of a character, however minor.

Lady Dedlock dismisses Rosa to protect her from any future
					disgrace, not because she’s unhappy with her. Rosa has served as
					a kind of daughter for Lady Dedlock. The kindness and affection
					with which she treats Rosa is much different from the haughty, cold
					manner in which she treats Mademoiselle Hortense, revealing that
					she views Rosa quite differently, as more than just a maid or attendant. Lady
					Dedlock, not given to warmth or physicality, at one point puts her
					hand on Rosa’s shoulder, which enrages Mademoiselle Hortense, who
					was never touched at all. This demonstrative gesture suggests the
					maternal instincts buried deep within Lady Dedlock, which become
					clear when she emotionally embraces Esther and reveals their relationship.
					Even though dismissing Rosa seems to be cruel, it’s actually the
					kindest thing Lady Dedlock can do. If Rosa is tainted by Lady Dedlock’s
					secret, her chances for a good marriage to the boy she loves will
					be ruined. Lady Dedlock could never help, protect, or nurture her
					own daughter, and she is perhaps trying to compensate for her past
					failures by protecting Rosa.

Jo’s death is a truly bleak moment, and the narrator takes
					the time to moralize about the injustice of his death. So few people
					ever treated Jo with kindness, who was forced to spend his life
					moving on from one place to the next, never welcome anywhere. The
					few times when he is welcomed end only in trouble or death. Krook’s
					lodger, for example, one of the people who treated Jo kindly, dies.
					When Jo is protected in the Bleak House stable, he is taken away
					in the middle of the night and forced back out on the street. At
					George’s Shooting Gallery he finds a safe place from the all-knowing,
					all-seeing man who he believes is chasing him, but here his sickness
					overtakes him. When he dies, the narrator grandly proclaims his
					death to the world: “Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. . . .
					Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And
					dying thus around us every day.” Sarcasm in evident in these lines:
					if we are born with compassion, it makes no sense for us to let children
					die on the street. The narrator sweeps all of us up in his final statement
					by using the inclusive “us,” implicating us in Jo’s death, as though
					we could have taken steps to stop it ourselves.
