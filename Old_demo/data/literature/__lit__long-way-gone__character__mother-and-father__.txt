Ishmael’s mother and father are only physically present in the beginning of the story, but Ishmael’s memory of them and the rest of the family serves as a driving force alongside his desire to simply survive. Ishmael remembers watching his mother cook and recalls her role in his naming ceremony, and he remembers that his father used to say: “If you are alive, there is hope for a better day and something good to happen. If there is nothing good left in the destiny of a person, he or she will die.” The second, final loss of his parents signifies Ishmael’s shift from hope to hopelessness.
