Mattie’s character constitutes the hinge on which the
				plot of Ethan Frome turns. All of the story’s events
				are set in motion by her presence in the Frome household. Yet we
				glimpse Mattie, as we glimpse Zeena, only through Ethan’s eyes,
				and his perception of her is skewed by his passion. With her grace,
				beauty, and vitality, she obviously embodies everything that he
				feels Zeena has denied him, and so becomes the focus of his aborted
				rebellion against his unhappy life. Mattie is distinguished by little
				other than the red decoration she wears, which symbolizes both passion
				and transgression.

Until the very end, we cannot even be certain that Mattie
				reciprocates Ethan’s feelings for her. When, at the climax of the
				novel, Mattie’s true self does shine through, we see her as an impulsive, melodramatic
				young woman, more adolescent than adult. Her most active deed of
				self-definition is persuading Ethan to attempt suicide, which reveals
				her as rather immature, ready to give in to whatever passionate
				(and foolish) thoughts enter her head. Yet, because the text has
				so strongly established Mattie as the horrid Zeena’s polar opposite,
				we forgive her childish delight in melodrama. Even in her recklessness,
				Mattie seems preferable to the shrewish, complaining, curmudgeonly
				Zeena: it is better that Ethan die a quick death with Mattie, we
				feel, than a slow one with Zeena. Nevertheless, one cannot help
				but suspect that Mattie may not be quite worth the passion that
				Ethan directs her way, and that the rebellion and escape she represents
				are more important than the pretty, flighty, and slightly absentminded
				girl she actually is.
