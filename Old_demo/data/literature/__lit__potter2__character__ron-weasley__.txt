Ron possesses the confidence of being a child deeply loved. Unlike Harry, he has no financial means. His father is a highly ranked member of the Ministry of Magic and his family is backed by generations of pure wizard blood, but Ron is often picked on by Malfoy for wearing tattered robes, for living in an old house, and for not having a rich father. Ron's poverty is a source of great insecurity for him, and he often responds to these taunts with violent, angry reactions. His attempts to respond using his wand often fail. He casts ill- conjured and often reversing spells. Ron is deeply loyal to the people he loves, including his family, Harry, and Hermione. He defends them with brutish desperation. He and Harry are inseparable, and Ron is often perceived as a sidekick of the famous Harry Potter. Ron feels valued by Harry and doesn't seem to mind this on a regular basis, although in spurts he seems to feel deflated and glossed over. He is adventurous, like Harry, and somewhat mischievous. He always has good intentions.
