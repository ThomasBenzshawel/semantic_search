Jokubas takes the family on a tour of Packingtown. They
					are amazed to see pens packed with tens of thousands of cattle,
					pigs, and sheep. The suffering of the animals, which will all be
					killed by the end of the day, daunts even Jurgis’s optimism. But
					the flurry of human activity fills Jurgis with wonder. Jokubas notes
					sarcastically the signs regarding the sanitation rules. The government
					inspector who checks the slaughtered pigs for signs of tuberculosis
					often lets several carcasses go unchecked. Spoiled meat is specially
					doctored in secret before it is scattered among the rest of the
					meat in preparation for canning and packing.

Jurgis begins his job of sweeping the entrails of slaughtered
					cattle through trap doors. Despite the stench, he is filled with
					optimism because he earns a little over two dollars for twelve hours
					of labor. There are more encouraging signs: Jonas has a lead on
					a job, and Marija obtains a job painting labels on cans for nearly
					two dollars a day. Jurgis refuses to allow Teta Elzbieta,
					Ona, or the children to work. He wants the children to go to school,
					especially thirteen-year-old Stanislovas. Dede Antanas has no luck
					finding a job because of his advanced age, and he begins to worry
					that he is a burden.

The family finds a paper advertising the sale of four-room
					homes for fifteen hundred dollars. Buyers need only pay three hundred
					dollars down and the monthly payment is twelve dollars. Ona, Marija, and
					Teta Elzbieta visit the real estate agent, a slick, well-dressed
					man who speaks Lithuanian. He tells them that the houses
					are going fast and that they must move quickly. Later, Ona quickly
					figures their budget, and it seems that they can make the payments.
					The entire family makes a trip to see the house. To their disappointment,
					it doesn’t look as new or big as the one in the advertisement. The
					basement and the attic aren’t completely finished. None of the other
					houses appear occupied. Jokubas later tells them the entire deal
					is probably a swindle.

Ona and Teta Elzbieta, accompanied by Jokubas, meet the
					agent to close the deal. Jokubas reads the contract and notices
					that it refers to the house as a “rental.” They get a lawyer but
					are dismayed to find that he is the agent’s friend. He tells them
					that everything is in order. Ona and Teta Elzbieta close the deal.
					Jurgis falls into a frenzy when he returns from work and hears the
					details. He grabs the deed and storms out to find a lawyer, who
					explains that the house is merely a rental until the purchase price
					is paid; the house is called a rental to make it easier to evict
					people who fail to make the monthly payments. Pacified, Jurgis returns
					home.

The family purchases household necessities and settles
					happily into their home. The pace of work in the slaughterhouse
					is demanding, but Jurgis doesn’t mind; he even enjoys it. He is
					surprised to find that everyone else hates their jobs and their
					bosses. Jurgis thinks that they are merely lazy and refuses to join
					the union, which is lobbying for a reduction in the pace of work.

One man promises Dede Antanas a job in exchange for one-third of
					his wages. Jurgis speaks to a friend and coworker, Tamoszius Kuszleika,
					about this practice. Tamoszius explains that corruption exists everywhere
					in Packingtown. From the top to bottom in the chain of power, people
					take advantage of one another. It is impossible to move ahead without
					taking part in the web of graft and corruption. Despite having to
					sacrifice a third of his wages, Antanas takes the job. He informs
					the family that he helps pack filthy meat for human consumption.

Marija learns that her job came at the expense of a fifteen-year employee.
					She also learns that Jonas obtained his job after his predecessor
					died as a result of the unsafe working conditions. Jurgis notes
					that unfit meat, such as calf fetuses and animals that have died of
					disease, are butchered and packed with the rest of the meat.

This section continues Sinclair’s demolition of the American
					Dream as he builds his argument against capitalism and for socialism.
					Jurgis, who still naïvely holds onto the American Dream, views the
					factories with undiluted optimism. Sinclair portrays him as utterly committed
					to the values of labor and family on which the American Dream is
					based. Again, he attempts to make Jurgis appear sympathetic to
					the average American reader. Unlike Jurgis, the more experienced Jokubas
					views the entire process with sarcasm because he knows better. He
					knows the corrupt owners of the vast meatpacking empire betray the
					values of the American Dream in every way possible.

The vast stockyards, packed with cattle, pigs, and sheep,
					demonstrate the marvelous efficiency of the economic machinery of
					the meatpacking industry. However, the animals packed into the stockyards
					and herded into slaughter serve also as metaphors for the immigrant
					laborers who crowd into Packingtown looking for the opportunity
					to earn a piece of the American Dream. Like these ill-fated animals,
					the unsuspecting Jurgis and other immigrants are herded into the
					machinery of capitalism and slaughtered en masse.

Sinclair’s description of the unsanitary and disgusting
					practices of the meat-packing industry consists of a two-pronged
					attack. First, he details the lack of sanitation in the factories
					in order to garner sympathy for the wage laborers who must work
					there. But the real impact of his exposé lies in his portrayal of
					the practice of selling diseased and rotten meat to the American
					public. Sinclair wants the reader to identify with the immigrant
					laborer through their victimization by the same enemy. The factory
					owners value their profits over the health of the workers and the
					public consumer.

The real-estate scam is another attack on capitalism.
					The agent lies when he says that the houses are “going fast” to
					pressure the family into acting without considering all of the conditions.
					The flyer advertising the houses is misleading. Moreover, the deed
					specifies that the house is a “rental” until it is paid for. The
					purpose is to make it easy to evict families when they start missing
					payments. With its emphasis on maximum profit, the scheme prioritizes
					corporate gain at the expense of the consumer. A poor family is
					given no leeway for missed or late payments. Instead, the family
					is thrown out of its home in times of financial crisis.

Tamoszius’s explanation of “graft” to Jurgis portrays
					capitalism as a machine that encourages and values corruption—anyone
					hoping to get ahead must become corrupt. Therefore, capitalism attacks the
					fundamental moral idea behind the American Dream, namely that hard,
					honest work earns its just reward. Sinclair attempts to show that,
					within capitalist economics, one cannot advance by means of hard
					work and a strong commitment to good social values. Instead, the
					enterprising individual must become a liar, thief, and predator
					to keep from being exploited.
