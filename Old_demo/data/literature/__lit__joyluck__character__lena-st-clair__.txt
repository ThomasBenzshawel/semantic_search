Lena St. Clair is caught in an unhappy marriage to Harold
				Livotny. Harold insists that the couple keep separate bank accounts
				and use a balance sheet to detail their monetary debts to one another. Although
				he believes that this policy will keep money out of the relationship,
				it in fact accomplishes the opposite, making money and obligation
				central to Lena and Harold’s conjugal life. Lena has inherited her
				mother Ying-ying’s belief in superstition and deems herself incapable
				of reversing what is “fated” to happen. She fails to take initiative
				to change her relationship, despite her recognition of its dysfunctional
				elements.

While still a child, Lena learns an important lesson from
				her neighbors. She constantly hears the mother and daughter in the adjacent
				apartment yelling, fighting, and even throwing things. She is shocked
				by the difference between these noisy confrontations and her own
				relationship with her mother, which is marked by silences and avoidance
				of conflict. Yet, when she realizes that the shouting and weeping
				she hears through the wall in fact express a kind of deep love between
				mother and daughter, she realizes the importance of expressing one’s
				feelings, even at the cost of peace and harmony. Although the neighboring
				family lives a life of conflict and sometimes even chaos, they possess
				a certainty of their love for each other that Lena feels to be lacking
				in her own home. Reflecting back on this episode of her life, Lena
				begins to realize how she might apply the lesson she learned then
				to her married life with Harold.
