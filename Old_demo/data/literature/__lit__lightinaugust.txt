Light in August, published in 1932, is a novel by Nobel Prize winning authorÂ William Faulkner that explores themes of race, religion, and identity in the American South. The plot follows three main characters: Lena Grove, a young pregnant woman searching for the father of her child; Joe Christmas, a biracial man who has been passing as white; and Gail Hightower, a disgraced former preacher. Through these characters, Faulkner examines the destructive power of racism and the search for individual and communal identity.
