Jesus’s identity is complex and changing throughout the
				Gospels of the New Testament. Jesus is at once a “bright morning
				star” (Rev. 22:16)
				and a small child who worries his mother sick because he stays at
				the temple for three extra days (Luke 2:46).
				Jesus is called a “glutton and a drunkard” by those who dislike
				him (Matthew 11:19), and
				he breaks social boundaries by associating with women and the poor.
				Jesus tells a man seeking eternal life to “go, sell what you own, and
				give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then
				come, follow me” (Mark 10:21).
				While Jesus blesses the peace-makers, the meek, and the pure in
				heart, he overturns the tables of the money changers in the temple,
				yelling that they have made God’s house “a den
				of robbers” (Mark 11:17).
				He is simultaneously a “Savior” (Luke 2:11)
				and a servant who lowers himself to the ground, washing the feet
				of his disciples (John 13:5).
				Jesus is bread (John 6:35),
				light (John 9:1),
				and water (John 7:38-39).
				He is also King of Kings, Lord of Lords (Rev. 19:16),
				and tells a disciple, “[J]ust as you did it to one of the least
				of these . . . you did it to me” (Matthew 25:40).
