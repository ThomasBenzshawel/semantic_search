Aron, as the Abel figure of his generation, is goodhearted
				and trusting like his father, Adam. Although Aron is likable and
				kind, his innate moral sensitivity is extreme, and it makes him
				fragile and easily susceptible to hurt. The sheltered Aron has a
				great deal of trouble facing the reality of human evil in the world,
				and Steinbeck builds a great deal of suspense in the second half
				of East of Eden regarding whether or not Aron will
				ever meet his mother, Cathy, and whether or not he will survive
				such an encounter. Gradually, Aron retreats into the shelter of
				the church, rejecting the love of Abra in favor of religious laws
				of chastity and devotion. For a time, Aron also uses higher education
				as an escape, as he flees to Stanford University but then returns
				home a short time later, miserable. As the second half of the novel
				progresses, Aron becomes less likable, as we sense that the shelters
				he seeks are hollow and that his pursuits are driven neither by
				true religious belief nor a desire for intellectual education. Ultimately,
				Aron is destroyed by the revelation that Cathy is his mother. He
				retreats into a final escape—enlistment in the army—and is killed
				in World War I. Aron’s death is foreshadowed not only by his role
				as an Abel figure, but also by Samuel Hamilton’s musing that Aron’s
				namesake, the biblical Aaron, did not make it to the Promised Land
				of Canaan.
