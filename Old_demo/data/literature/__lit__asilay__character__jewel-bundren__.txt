Because Jewel speaks very few words of his own throughout
				the novel, he is defined by his actions, as filtered through the
				eyes of other characters. Jewel’s uncommunicative nature creates
				a great distance between him and us, and a great deal of room exists
				for debating the meaning of Jewel’s actions. Darl’s frequent descriptions
				of Jewel as “wooden” reinforce the image of Jewel as impenetrable
				to others, and also establish a relationship between Jewel and the
				wooden coffin that comes to symbolize his mother. Whether or not
				Jewel returns his mother’s devotion is also debatable—his behavior
				toward her while she is alive seems callous. Even as Addie lies
				on her deathbed, Jewel refuses to say good-bye to her, and harshly
				asserts his independence from her earlier on with his purchase of
				a horse. Jewel’s actions after Addie’s death show, however, that
				Jewel does care deeply about her, as he makes great sacrifices to assure
				the safe passage of her body to her chosen resting place, agreeing
				even to the sale of his beloved horse. Similarly, Jewel’s cold, rough-spoken
				behavior toward the rest of his family contrasts sharply with the
				heroic devotion he demonstrates in his deeds, such as when he searches
				valiantly for Cash’s tools after the river-crossing and nearly comes
				to blows with a stranger whom he believes has insulted the family.
				In general, Jewel is an independent, solitary man of action, and
				these traits put him in an antagonistic relationship with the introspective
				Darl.
