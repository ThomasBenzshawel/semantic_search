Esi Sekyi is the paradigm of the strong, independent woman. In addition to
				having a job that pays more than her husband’s job, Esi owns the home in which
				she lives. She has a master’s degree and genuinely enjoys her career. Advancing
				within her profession is as much a priority for her as her family. Given the
				traditional role that women were generally expected to play within the family,
				Esi’s strong will and independent nature is unique. Esi comes to represent the
				emergence of a new feminine identity—one that can compete equally with men in
				terms of financial and personal security. At the same time that Esi may want the
				freedom to pursue her own career and desires, she still very much wants to love
				and be loved. What she sees in Ali is the potential to have both the freedom
				that she desires and the love that she needs. Although Esi tries very hard to
				live her life according to rational principles, she finds herself feeling
				devastated and lonely because of her relationship with Ali.
