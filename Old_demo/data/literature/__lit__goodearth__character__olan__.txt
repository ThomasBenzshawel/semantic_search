In many ways the strongest and most memorable character
				in The Good Earth, O-lan exemplifies the situation
				of women in traditional China and the sacrifices they had to make
				in order to adhere to cultural notions of feminine respectability.
				O-lan spends her life working for an endeavor for which she never
				sees a reward: she gives all her effort and applies all her considerable
				capability to improving Wang Lung’s position, and she receives neither
				loyalty nor passion from him in return. He is annoyed when she becomes pregnant
				with her second child, fearing that her condition will keep her
				from working in the fields, and later he has no qualms about cruelly
				insulting her unbound feet and taking her treasured pearls to give
				to his concubine. O-lan spends much of the novel in the position
				of victim, but she gains a great deal of dignity in the reader’s eyes
				by stolidly and uncomplainingly enduring her husband’s behavior.
				It is O-lan who makes many of the hardest decisions in the novel—smothering
				her infant daughter to spare food for the family, for instance—and
				she bears these hard decisions with admirable fortitude.

Because O-lan is so reticent, silence being a quality
				that is highly valued in wives in Wang Lung’s culture, Buck uses
				means other than speech to indicate the extent of O-lan’s inner
				pain. For instance, on her wedding night, O-lan unconsciously flinches
				away from Wang Lung, which suggests that she has been abused as
				a slave in the House of Hwang. O-lan never complains about Wang
				Lung’s cruelty in insulting her feet—but she does immediately begin
				binding her daughter’s feet, warning her daughter not to complain
				of the pain for fear of angering Wang Lung. We see the extent of
				O-lan’s bravery when she makes no complaint for years and years
				about the grave illness that swells her belly. O-lan represents
				the dignity and courage of the marginalized wife.
