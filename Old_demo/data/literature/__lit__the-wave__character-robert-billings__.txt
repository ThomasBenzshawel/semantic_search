Initially described as “the class loser,” Robert Billings is the frequent victim of bullying and believes he’ll never live up to his older brother, Jeff, a former star student-athlete at Gordon High. Robert isn’t merely suffering from low self-esteem, however. He’s also deeply disengaged from life, evidenced by his falling asleep during Mr. Ross’s film about the Holocaust. As Mrs. Saunders later points out to Laurie, Robert’s characteristics make him especially susceptible to brainwashing and blindly latching onto a movement that promises equality, however hollowly, and that brings a sense of purpose, however shallow. As The Wave rises, Robert transforms into one of its most prominent figures, and most zealous defenders, calling Laurie a “threat” who “must be stopped” when The Grapevine’s exposé threatens to crush the movement. Later, when Mr. Ross finally reveals that The Wave was an experiment meant to show students how fascism affects human behavior, it’s clear that Robert has the most to lose: He’s left alone, again, sobbing in the school auditorium. Fortunately, Mr. Ross sees Robert’s reaction and invites him out for a meal, knowing that Robert, now more than ever, needs kindness, guidance, and support to grow.
