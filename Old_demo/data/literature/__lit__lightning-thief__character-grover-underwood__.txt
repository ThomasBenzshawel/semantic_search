Grover, a satyr, is first introduced as Percy’s anxious young friend. Grover is initially viewed as weak not only for his crippled legs, but also for his timid personality. Percy later learns that Grover is a satyr who has been assigned as a keeper and protector of Percy. Although Grover has taken on the tumultuous task of joining Percy’s quest, he fears that he will fail Percy and the entire world because he failed on a prior mission. With encouragement from Percy and Annabeth, Grover starts believing in his own potential by fighting off monsters and saving his friends while working to obtain his searcher’s license in order to find Pan. Grover serves as the voice of compassion and morality that allows Percy to reflect on his actions and pursue justice fairly. Throughout the quest, Grover proves he is capable of both trusting Annabeth and Percy and being a useful companion. Grover achieves his goal of obtaining his searcher’s license and goes to look for Pan at the end of the novel.
