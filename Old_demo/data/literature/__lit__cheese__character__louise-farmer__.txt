Louise has the hardest time adjusting to her new life. She sequesters herself in her room and is unable to maintain intimacy with Adam and David. Moreover, she lives in fear of what she calls the "Never Knows"â€”never knowing what will happen next, never knowing whom to trust, never knowing if the next phone call is from an enemy. More than the rest of the family, Louise grasps most to her past, making weekly calls to her only living relative, Martha, a cloistered nun. She is also the only one who defies Grey, saving some mementos from their former life despite the risk, and openly admits to Adam her hatred of him. Louise despises how a man whose very name is a mystery can puppeteer their lives.
