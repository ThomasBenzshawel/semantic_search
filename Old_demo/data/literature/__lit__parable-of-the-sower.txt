Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler is a seminal work of dystopian science fiction published in 1993. Through diary entries written between 2024 and 2027, the novel tells the story of a visionary teenage girl who flees her Los Angeles-area enclave with a group of followers amid social and environmental collapse. This 1994  New York Times Notable Book of the Year has been lauded as a groundbreaking work of climate fiction for its prescient treatment of racial inequity, substance abuse, fascism, global warming’s effects on wealth disparity, and sexual violence. Parable of the Sower has since been adapted into an opera and a graphic novel.
