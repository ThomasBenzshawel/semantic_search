Angela’s Ashes: A Memoir is an autobiographical work by Frank McCourt that was first published in 1996. McCourt describes his harrowing experiences as a young boy in Limerick, Ireland, in the 1930s and 1940s. At the center of the story is McCourt’s mother, Angela, who despite constant poverty, a criminally irresponsible husband, and the death of three children, is a loving mother who retains her sense of humor. While she must sacrifice her standards of dignity to provide for her children, she never lowers her expectations for her sons as she raises them to be well-behaved, conscientious, kind, and hardworking.
