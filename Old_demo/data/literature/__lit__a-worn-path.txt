First published in February 1941 in The Atlantic Monthly magazine, “A Worn Path” is one of Eudora Welty’s best known short stories. Grappling with the racial issues of the time, “A Worn Path” tells the story of an elderly Black woman who undertakes an arduous journey to fetch medicine for her grandson. An examination of the effects of racism on those who survived slavery in the Deep South, the story won the prestigious O. Henry Award and was instrumental in Welty receiving her first Guggenheim Award in 1942.
