Aunt Emily is a smart, energetic woman who campaigns relentlessly on
				behalf of Japanese Canadians. She insists on the importance of facing
				up to the past, of talking about it, analyzing it, protesting it, and
				understanding it. All of her conference-attending, letter-writing,
				and data-compiling is founded on the idea that only by understanding
				the past can we expunge our anger over former mistakes and thereby
				prevent ourselves and others from repeating them. A passionate woman,
				she cares deeply about her family members and their happiness. Her
				intelligence is admirable, as is her engagement with the world she
				lives in. Still, her obsession with chronicling the past, and her
				efforts at advocacy, are treated with deep ambivalence. Emily witnessed
				plenty of appalling sights during the war, but there is some suggestion
				that she wasn’t in the trenches with Obasan and Uncle, or Father
				and Mother, and doesn’t quite grasp how painful it is for other
				people to remember their wartime experiences. To that end, Naomi
				remains skeptical about Aunt Emily’s constant flurry of letters
				and petitions. Aunt Emily is a whirlwind of energy, but it is never
				clear that her efforts make more of an impact than does, for example,
				Obasan’s deeply quiet and concentrated focus on her immediate family
				members.
