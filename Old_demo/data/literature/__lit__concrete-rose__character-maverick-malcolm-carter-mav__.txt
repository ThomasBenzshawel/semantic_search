Maverick is the protagonist of Concrete Rose. Throughout the story, he goes by his nickname, Mav. Mav and his mother Faye have been on their own since Mav was eight years old, and that self-reliance has pushed Mav to have a tough exterior. The news of King Jr.’s paternity immediately challenges that toughness, and it becomes clear that Mav’s hardened exterior is only superficial. He grapples with intense and often complex emotions that he does not yet have the maturity to process. He is so caught up in the day-to-day challenges of caring for a baby, holding down a part-time job, dealing on the side, and going to school that he can’t stop to see a path forward for himself. Mav has the insight to understand how dramatically his life changes, but for much of his story he lacks the perspective to see how his choices impact his future and that of his children. Mav slowly unlearns the negative messaging surrounding manhood and comes to carve a life outside of the gangs and drugs.

Mav has a deep sense of loyalty to the people he loves, especially Faye, Dre, and Lisa. Mav’s relationships with others help him learn how to fully process his emotions. He is tender with his son even though Seven’s care is such an emotional and financial burden. Mav does his best to respect Faye and Lisa, but he worries so much about disappointing them that he holds back on sharing his troubles with them, even when they might be able to help him. Although he is more forthcoming with his father, he often lets his bitterness about Adonis’ absence get in the way of any meaningful exchanges.
