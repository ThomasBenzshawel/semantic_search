Juliana Frink, Frank’s ex-wife, is the only character to pursue the question “What is the truth?” to its literal end. She’s described as beautiful, dark, and exotic-looking. Juliana is in no man’s land both literally and figuratively, as she lives in the Rocky Mountain States, the politically neutral strip of land dividing the United States, and is an American woman teaching judo. Frink describes Juliana as screwball and infuriating, yet resigned to the idea that she had to be in his life for some divine purpose since he can’t get over her.  Juliana puts her life in the hands of fate when she connects with Joe Cinnadella, who turns out to be a German assassin. 

Above all, Juliana’s obsessed with the truth. She’s fascinated by the novel The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, Hawthorne Abendsen’s alternate history novel where the Allied powers won the war. She insists that the Germans are evil, and she wants to know how and why Abendsen wrote his story. When she finally corners Abendsen in his own home, she presses him to reveal that I Ching wrote the book, not him. When Juliana presses even further, the I Ching declares it wrote the book for “Inner Truth.” Juliana allows herself to be truth’s servant, in this way, and it is through Juliana that the question of the nature of truth receives some resolution.
