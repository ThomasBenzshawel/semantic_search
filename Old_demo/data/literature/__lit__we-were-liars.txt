E Lockhart’s We Were Liars is a postmodern YA novel that was published in 2014. Narrator Cadence Sinclair combines prose, verse, and fairytales to tell the story of her family, now in its third generation. These wealthy New Englanders have the privilege of retreating from the world to their own private Beechwood Island. Tragically, they bring with them their own desperate love, rare and expensive possessions, and the lies they tell to maintain their status. Lockhart weaves a dreamy, suspenseful tale of the lengths we have to go to understand our families and ourselves.
