In the sections of the novel in which he describes his
				experience in the war, Henry portrays himself as a man of duty.
				He attaches to this understanding of himself no sense of honor,
				nor does he expect any praise for his service. Even after he has
				been severely wounded, he discourages Rinaldi from pursuing medals
				of distinction for him. Time and again, through conversations with
				men like the priest, Ettore Moretti, and Gino, Henry distances
				himself from such abstract notions as faith, honor, and patriotism.
				Concepts such as these mean nothing to him beside such concrete
				facts of war as the names of the cities in which he has fought and
				the numbers of decimated streets.

Against this bleak backdrop, Henry’s reaction to Catherine
				Barkley is rather astonishing. The reader understands why Henry responds
				to the game that Catherine proposes—why he pledges his love to a
				woman he barely knows: like Rinaldi, he hopes for a night’s simple
				pleasures. But an active sex drive does not explain why Henry returns
				to Catherine—why he continues to swear his love even after Catherine
				insists that he stop playing. In his fondness for Catherine, Henry
				reveals a vulnerability usually hidden by his stoicism and masculinity.
				The quality of the language that Henry uses to
				describe Catherine’s hair and her presence in bed testifies to the
				genuine depth of his feelings for her. Furthermore, because he allows
				Henry to narrate the book, Hemingway is able to suffuse the entire
				novel with the power and pathos of an elegy: A Farewell
					to Arms, which Henry narrates after Catherine’s death,
				confirms his love and his loss.
