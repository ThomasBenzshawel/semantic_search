Alberto is Leviâ€™s best friend and his compatriot from Italy. They share many essential things, including the Italian language, a rare comfort in the multilingual Auschwitz camp. Alberto and Levi also studied chemistry at the university. They have the same strength of character that enables them to be peace-loving, and their curiosity helps them creatively scheme to better their lots rather than waste time bemoaning them. Alberto has emotional intelligence that equips him to communicate with anyone, no matter their language. His restless intellect and optimism lead him to leave with the evacuees rather than stay in the camp with Levi. Alberto is the man Levi wants to be, a person of action and not self-pity.
