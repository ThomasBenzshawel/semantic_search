					Vacationing with Aunt Juley in Swanage,
					Margaret receives a letter from Mr. Wilcox,
					saying that he is moving to a different house and
					would be willing to rent the Schlegels his old one.
					He asks Margaret to come and inspect it.  Margaret
					has a sudden premonition that he means to propose to
					her, but she dismisses the notion as silly.  She
					makes the trip back to London, and takes a tour of
					the house with Mr. Wilcox--who, quite suddenly,
					does propose.  Margaret is overcome with a
					surprising joy.  She promises to write to him
					the next day with an answer, and returns to Swanage to
					talk things over with Helen.
				


					Helen is appalled, thinking that, beneath their
					veneer of competence and confidence, the Wilcox men
					are made of "panic and emptiness."  But Margaret
					defends Mr. Wilcox, and finally accepts his proposal.
					She is determined not to lose her independence, and
					thinks that love must solidify rather than transform
					their friendship.  Mr. Wilcox travels to Swanage at
					once with the engagement ring, and he and Margaret
					take a walk together by the sea.  Margaret realizes
					that Mr. Wilcox is afraid of emotion.  His motto is
					"Concentrate," while hers is "Only connect."  He
					kisses her suddenly, and she thinks that if she could
					only teach him to connect his passionate subconscious
					to his restrained, moralistic exterior self, she
					could help him, but he is too obdurate to be helped.
					When Helen tells him that she has received a letter
					from Leonard, saying that on Mr. Wilcox's
					advice he has left the Porphyrion for a much
					lower-paying job at a bank, Mr. Wilcox replies that the
					Porphyrion is not a bad company.  Helen is outraged:
					Not long before, Mr. Wilcox had said that the
					Porphyrion was doomed to fail.  Mr. Wilcox refuses to
					take responsibility for the matter, arguing that the
					struggles of the poor are merely part of the "battle
					of life."
				


					When Charles receives the note from his father
					announcing the engagement, he blames Dolly: If
					she had not introduced Evie to her fiance, Mr.
					Wilcox would not have been lonely, and would not have
					been inclined to propose to Margaret.  Charles
					suspects Margaret of wanting to get her hands on
					Howards End, and says that he will only tolerate her
					as long as she behaves herself.
				


					After two failed attempts to unite the Schlegels and
					the Wilcoxes--and the aspects of the British upper
					class that they symbolize--Forster makes a third,
					climactic attempt in Chapter 18.  In the first four
					chapters of the novel, we saw Helen's failed
					romance with Paul; later, we saw Margaret's
					more successful, but still tentative, friendship with
					Ruth Wilcox.  Now, in Chapter 18, Forster
					introduces the most charged attempt yet at a
					connection between the cultural idealism of the
					Schlegels and the pragmatic idealism of the Wilcoxes:
					a marriage between Margaret and Mr. Wilcox (who
					is referred to as "Henry" for the rest of the novel).
				


					Given the different treatments they have received in
					the novel so far--Margaret is a sympathetic,
					appealing protagonist, and Henry a vaguely
					hypocritical, somewhat pompous minor character--it
					may be difficult to fathom what might attract
					Margaret to a man like Henry.  But throughout the
					book, Margaret has shown a fundamental sympathy to
					the Wilcoxes and to the "solid," hard-working
					Englishmen who make Margaret's leisurely life
					possible.  As she says to Helen, she is tired of
					enjoying her money and criticizing the men who secure
					it for her.  Beginning with her Christmas shopping
					trip with Mrs. Wilcox, and exacerbated by her
					dealings with Leonard Bast, Margaret has
					developed a profound appreciation for money and all
					that it represents.  She is not a materialist, but
					she understands that her brand of idealism could exist
					without the leisure and security afforded by
					money.  While Helen, who is more impulsive and flighty
					than Margaret, believes that poverty is somehow more
					"real" than wealth, Margaret understands that poverty
					only makes men suspicious and mean; men and women need
					financial security in order to develop their moral,
					intellectual, and spiritual selves.  In this, Forster
					hints at a connection between the "seen" (the material
					world of money and work) and the "unseen" (the moral,
					intellectual, and spiritual).  Margaret's attraction
					to Henry, and her unexpected happiness at his
					proposal, is in large part founded on her deep
					appreciation for "the outer world of telegrams and
					anger"--the seen, the material, the qualities
					symbolized by Henry and his family.
				


					Still, Margaret and Henry remain extremely different
					people who represent extremely different ideas.
					Their differences are underscored by the credos each
					of them espouse in this section.  Henry says that his
					motto is "Concentrate."  He believes in seeing the
					world "steadily," or, as Margaret sees it, in focusing
					on the particular circumstances around him and
					disregarding whatever he considers to be
					irrelevant.  Margaret's motto, which is the epigraph
					quoted at the opening of the novel itself, is "Only
					connect."  She believes in seeing the world "whole," in
					making connections between herself and others, between the
					seen and the unseen, between the physical and the
					spiritual.  The difference between "Concentrating"
					and "Only connecting" is the difference between
					Margaret and Henry; it is the difference between the
					Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, and the primary conflict
					in Howards End.
