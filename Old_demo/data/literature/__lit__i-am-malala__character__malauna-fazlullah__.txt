Fazlullah embodies the same greed and manipulation that drove many past leaders to take advantage of the Pakistani people. In 2005, he arrives in Mingora and sets up a local radio station. Initially moderate in his messaging, Fazlullah lulls the people of the village into a false sense of security by portraying himself as a Robinhood figure and preaching the rather uncontroversial view that people need more prayer in their life. Over time, his rhetoric slowly becomes more militant as he convinces listeners of the need to turn to sharia law.  Ziauddin never trusts him and openly voices his unpopular opinions about the “Radio Mullah,” and Malala can see that Fazlullah preys on the ignorance of the people just as her father warned her. However, Fazlullah is as convincing as he is evil so just as Ziauddin predicted, most people do not understand that he is distorting the Quran because they have not been taught the true meaning of the passages he references. Thus, Fazlullah mentally imprisons the people of the village before any real violence begins. Once everyone is under Fazlullah’s spell, he includes schools in his restrictions, furthering his assault on knowledge. He begins preaching strict practices and forbids girls from attending school. Although a Taliban soldier shoots Malala, Fazlullah and other leaders like him are as much to blame because of the insidious way they spread lies.
