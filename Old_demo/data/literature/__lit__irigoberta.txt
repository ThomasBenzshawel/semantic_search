I, Rigoberta Menchú: An Indian Woman in Guatemala is a testimonial memoir of Guatemalan human rights and indigenous rights activist Rigoberta Menchú Tum that was first published in 1983. The controversial book is the result of Menchú—then 23—describing her harrowing and courageous life up to that point to Venezuelan anthropologist Elisabeth Burgos-Debray, who then edited Menchú’s testimony into I, Rigoberta Menchú. In 1992, nine years after the book’s release, Menchú would win the Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the indigenous K’iche’ people of the Americas and of indigenous people internationally.
