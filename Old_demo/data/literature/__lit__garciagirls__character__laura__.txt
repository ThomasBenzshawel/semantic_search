Laura comes from a very wealthy, privileged and influential
				family in the Dominican Republic. As a daughter of the de la Torre
				clan and a doctor's wife, she considers herself entitled to a degree
				of social respect and material privilege that is unrealistic to
				expect as a recent immigrant. Her frustration with the challenges
				of immigration is reflected in her snobbery, yet she attempts to
				make a new identity for herself as an American wife, mother, and
				inventor of household gadgets. She defends her daughters' individuality
				and creativity and supports them through their mental breakdowns.
				She is intensely proud of her family name, her children and her
				grandchildren.
