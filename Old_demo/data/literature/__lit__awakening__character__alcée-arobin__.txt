The tantalizing Alcée Arobin represents the danger of passion and its threat to Edna’s autonomy. Before we even meet Alcée, we learn from Doctor Mandelet that Alcée has the power to ruin reputations, suggesting that he is a sinister or threatening figure. Although he does not appear sinister at first, Alcée’s flattering manner tests Edna’s boundaries while giving her the illusion of having control. For example, when Edna reacts badly to Alcée kissing her hand, Alcée tells Edna that he could not help himself because of his “emotions,” portraying himself as overcome by love. Therefore, Edna believes that because she doesn’t love Alcée, she is in a position of control in their relationship. Nevertheless, when Edna asks Alcée to leave her at the pigeon house, he uses “gentle, seductive entreaties” to convince her to have sex with him instead. By asking her until she agrees, Alcée manifests a form of control over their relationship in which he gradually erodes Edna’s boundaries and turns her passion against her. In this way, Alcée has a corrosive effect not just on Edna’s reputation but on her own autonomy because he knows how to convince her to follow her sexual arousal instead of emotional needs and desires.
