With purple eyes and silvery hair, thirteen-year-old Daenerys Targaryen looks like the queen she longs to be and the mother of dragons she actually is. And much like the three dragons she is raising, Daenerys is learning the extent of her power. The young Daenerys becomes increasingly authoritative over the course of the novel as she learns to wield the power she has been given as a former Dothraki queen and mother of dragons. As the last living descendant of House Targaryen, she has spent her entire life in exile in the lands across the narrow sea. At the end of Game of Thrones, Daenerys lost her husband and, with him, much of her authority over her Dothraki followers. Now, she has to hold onto them while she attempts to find a way to gather support as she plans to conquer Westeros, avenge the deaths of her family, and reclaim the Iron Throne. Intelligent and perceptive as well as beautiful, Daenerys must weave her way through a nest of men trying to take advantage of her in one way or another.
