Gandalf is a Wizard of surpassing power and wisdom, but
				when we first meet him he merely appears to be a wizened old man
				driving a wagon full of fireworks. This mix of the awe-inspiring
				and the touchingly human defines Gandalf. He is as comfortable at
				a Hobbit birthday party as at the Council of Elrond, and he counts
				both the celestial Galadriel and the lowly Barliman Butterbur among
				his friends. This quality makes Gandalf a more sympathetic character than
				the sometimes aloof Elves. It also gives him insights that even the
				wise Elrond misses, as when Gandalf supports Pippin and Merry’s
				wish to be included in the Fellowship on the grounds that their
				loyalty to Frodo makes up for their lack of experience and strength.

Paradoxically, we see Gandalf grow in power throughout The Fellowship
					of the Ring even as he comes up against obstacles that show
				him at the limits of his power. He is tested again and again, whether
				by Saruman or at the Door to Moria or, finally, on the Bridge of
				Khazad-dûm. In some of these moments Gandalf responds with a blazing
				magical spell or a feat of wizardry, but in others he triumphs in
				more modest, human ways. After many unsuccessful attempts to open
				the Door to Moria, Gandalf finally realizes that the password is
				a deceptively simple riddle. When he cannot remember which way to
				go in the tunnels of Moria, he calms himself down with a smoke.
				As we see later, in The Two Towers, Gandalf returns, having
				survived his battle with the fearsome Balrog and been made even
				more powerful by his trial. Nevertheless, even at the height of his
				powers, Gandalf retains his common touch.
