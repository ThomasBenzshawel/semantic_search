Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 Years is an oral history memoir by Sarah Delany, Elizabeth Delany, and Amy Hill Hearth that was first published in 1993. New York Times journalist Amy Hill Hearth publishes an article about two centenarian sisters—“Sadie” and “Bessie” Delany—about their long lives. Its success leads Hill to conduct oral interviews with the two over many months, resulting in the book. In Having Our Say, the Delanys recount their remarkable life experiences as they confronted the twin challenges of being Black and being women in a society that discriminated against both things.
