The name Phoebe derives from the Greek word “phoibos,”
				which means “shining.” Phoebe is therefore an appropriate name for
				a character who brings the only rays of light into the somber Pyncheon
				home. At times, Phoebe literally brings a breath of fresh air into
				the house, throwing open her windows, rearranging her room, and
				coaxing the garden back to health and beauty from its state of decay
				and disarray. Phoebe’s good nature is bolstered by a strong sense
				of moral judgment and wisdom. Within the novel’s morally ambiguous
				maelstrom, Phoebe emerges as a voice of reason. Holgrave makes the
				mistake of thinking he can read her like a book and is subsequently
				forced to retract this condescending view. Phoebe continues to surprise
				us by showing great strength and moral fortitude, unlike many of
				the other corruptible and malicious characters who pervade the novel.
				After the Judge’s death, for example, Phoebe enters the eerie confines
				of the house, and later argues that witnesses should be called,
				despite Holgrave’s feverish protest. Phoebe has the courage to resist
				her own heart and to endure being dismayed by Holgrave’s first proposal—she
				forces the man she loves to change rather than changing herself
				to suit him.
