Originally published in serial form, Around the World in 80 Days is a classic adventure novel by the French author Jules Verne. It was first published in book form in 1873 to wide acclaim. The novel tells the story of the wealthy British gentleman Phileas Fogg and his French valet, Passepartout, and their attempt to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. Around the World in 80 Days has been adapted into several plays and film versions, including a 1956 film starring David Niven that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The story even inspired real-life attempts, including one by American journalist Nellie Bly, who completed the trip in just seventy-two days in 1890.
