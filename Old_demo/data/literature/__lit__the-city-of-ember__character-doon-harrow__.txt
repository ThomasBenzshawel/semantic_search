Like Lina, Doon has a sense of urgency about him, but where Lina externalizes her boundless energy Doon turns his inwards. When he feels that a situation is unfair or that he is not being heard he becomes angry, and his actions that follow often result in what his father refers to as “unintended consequences.” Despite his good intentions and sincere desire to right society’s wrongs, sometimes he cannot get out of his own way.

Ironically, it is Lina and her endless energy that calms Doon down. When she recognizes him as a kindred spirit and becomes Doon’s sounding board, he discovers his ability to articulate his ideas more clearly when they are together. While Doon sometimes botches the execution, his instincts are initially sound most of the time, and his dedication to solving a problem is matched only by his dedication to Lina and his desire to enlighten the citizens of Ember.
