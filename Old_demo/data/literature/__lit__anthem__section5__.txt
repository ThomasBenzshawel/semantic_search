Equality 7-2521 discovers how to
					make a lightbulb work. He believes he alone has made light. He has
					found the materials for making the lightbulb in the tunnel where
					he is hiding, and he has used wires to make electricity flow through
					the lightbulb and produce light. He is amazed that the light has
					come from the heart of the metal, without flint or fire. He compares
					the glowing flint to the crack in the walls of a prison. Equality 7-2521 realizes
					the meaning of the lightbulb—that he can provide clean and bright
					light for all the cities in the world—and he determines that his
					discovery is too important not to be shared with the world. He concludes
					that electricity is the key to harnessing nature’s power and that
					he must bring it to the world.

Equality 7-2521 also concludes
					that he must be allowed into the Home of the Scholars, where there
					are rooms to experiment and where he can ask the help of the other
					scholars, in whom he has great faith. He concludes that there is
					enough work ahead that all the scholars of the world should work
					together to make progress with his new invention.

A month later, the World Council of Scholars, a group
					of the wisest scholars from all over the world, is to convene for
					its annual meeting, and this year, the meeting is in Equality 7-2521’s
					city. He resolves to go to the World Council and show them his invention. He
					will tell the council members the whole story of its discovery,
					and he believes they will be so impressed that they will forgive
					him for all his sins and transgressions. He decides that the World
					Council will speak to the Council of Vocations and have him reassigned
					from street sweeper to scholar so that he may continue his research.

Equality 7-2521 resolves to guard
					his tunnel with his life because no one but the World Council of
					Scholars will understand the significance of the light, and the
					light is the most important thing. In mid-thought, he suddenly realizes
					that he cares about his body. He believes the lightbulb is a part
					of his physical being and he wants to see the body that helped bring
					the bulb into existence. Until this point, he has never seen his
					body, but now he stretches out his arms and legs and realizes his
					own strength. Despite knowing that it is wrong to want it, he wants
					to see his own reflection. 

Equality 7-2521 writes that he
					was so excited about his discovery of the lightbulb that he forgot
					to pay attention to the time, and he was late in returning to the
					Home of the Street Sweepers. The Council of the Home asked him where
					he was, and he would not answer. Without emotion, the Council ordered
					Equality 7-2521 to be held in the Palace
					of Corrective Detention until he told the Council where he had been.

Equality 7-2521 writes that at
					the Palace of Correction, he was stripped and tied to a post where
					he was whipped and beaten while being asked where he had been. He
					lost consciousness and woke in a cell, happy that he had not betrayed
					the tunnel and the light. He stayed in the cell in the Palace of
					Corrective Detention until he realized that it was the day before
					the meeting of the World Council of Scholars. He then broke out
					of the Palace, which was easy because no precautions had been taken
					to prevent escape since no one had ever tried to do so before. He
					snuck back to his tunnel, where he writes this entry, reveling in
					the idea that the next day will bring atonement and reunification
					with his brothers.

Equality 7-2521’s belief that the
					lightbulb is too significant not to be shared, a belief that comes
					to have disastrous consequences for him, represents exactly the
					kind of thinking against which Rand is writing. He thinks that the
					lightbulb, a technological innovation, can be the crack in the wall
					of his prison, a way to reach all the members of his society and
					share with them what he has discovered in his tunnel. Rand shows,
					through Equality 7-2521, how such thinking
					leads to painful results. She believes that invention and progress
					are worthy not because they help the masses but rather in and of
					themselves, because they are the result of the individual mind working
					and expressing itself.

This section is the most hopeful part of the novella,
					and it is in this section that we most identify with Equality 7-2521.
					Here, he still wants to make the world a better place for himself
					and for his brothers, and he believes he has a way to do so. Moreover,
					the harsh punishment visited on Equality 7-2521 when
					he returns late from the tunnel and will not tell the Council where
					he has been foreshadows the violence that we fear will be brought
					to bear against him at the World Council. Though Rand claims not
					to have imbued Anthem with a traditional structure,
					this section, in which we sympathize with Equality 7-2521, builds
					the story’s tension and gives us the expectation of a climax in
					the coming confrontation with the World Council of Scholars.

Equality 7-2521’s sense of self-worth
					is entirely caught up in the significance of the lightbulb, as is
					the proper result, in Rand’s view, of allowing for individual benefit
					from individual discovery. Equality 7-2521’s
					increasing vanity and his desire to know his own strength are related
					to his belief that he has discovered something important and that
					his body is worth knowing. Thus, even after he has been beaten,
					he revels in his own strength at not succumbing to the beating and
					revealing his tunnel and the lightbulb. He harnesses his own strength
					at the same time he harnesses the strength of electricity, and he
					takes equal pride in both. His willingness to suffer for the lightbulb
					stems from his belief that the invention is an extension of his
					own physical being and is more important than his own body, which
					he has only recently begun to value.

The scene in the Palace of Corrective Detention in which
					Equality 7-2521 is flogged while bound naked
					to a post directly correlates to the Christian story about the scourging
					of Christ at the pillar. In the Christian story, Christ is dragged
					before the Roman authorities, stripped of his clothes, and beaten
					mercilessly at a pillar while being mocked by Roman soldiers shortly
					before being crucified. Rand uses the scene here to heighten our
					sense that Equality 7-2521 is a new prophet
					who must suffer great abuses, at the hands of tormenters, in the
					interest of his beliefs. By comparing Equality 7-2521 to Christ,
					Rand may offend some readers who believe that Christ is the son
					of God and that such comparisons are irreverent, and she may well
					have intended to give offense. She often said she was trying to reclaim
					religious language from religion, in order to prove that it was
					possible to worship an ideal without believing in the supernatural.
					The blatant comparison that this scene at the post invites is an attempt
					to reclaim religious imagery as well, just as is the heavy-handed
					image of Equality 7-2521 as the bringer of
					light to the world.

This section, like others in the novella, contains countless
					contrasting pairs, which emphasize, often blatantly, the battle
					between shapeless, nameless evil and vain, proud good. Specifically,
					Equality 7-2521’s high emotion and proud
					intentions contrast directly with the Council’s boredom while sentencing
					him to the Palace of Corrective Detention. The violence of the Council
					also contrasts with Equality 7-2521’s passive
					resistance. Similarly, the light of the bulb, weak though it is,
					significantly outshines the darkness of a society lit only by candles.
					Furthermore, Equality 7-2521’s care in protecting his
					tunnel stands in opposition to the carelessness of those in charge of
					guarding the Palace of Corrective Detention. These pairings further
					highlight Rand’s belief that everything about Equality 7-2521 makes
					different from those around him. Society wallows in apathetic, dim
					insecurity, while Equality 7-2521 covetously
					guards his precious light. In these pairings, society always comprises
					the weaker half, with much less invested, while Equality 7-2521,
					fighting bitterly and to the death for his ideals, always comprises
					the stronger half.
