Chris has been a part of the popular crowd for most of her life. She is the alpha female among her friends. She uses this position not to extract joy from her elevated status, but to inflict pain on other people, primarily weaker peers who present no threat to her. She benefits from her father’s position as an attorney, both because he is wealthy and because he is able to pull strings on her behalf, and this privilege has allowed her to feel superior to others. Perhaps she has inherited her father’s killer instincts, as she will stop at nothing to destroy Carrie even when it is clear that Carrie’s retaliation could have far greater implications than that from the people Chris usually bullies.

What matters the most to Chris is victory. Billy also matters to her, but she is mistaken when she thinks that she can best him as well; however, that does not stop her from trying because she is used to getting whatever she desires. She uses her sexuality, her words, and even her fists in an attempt to control Billy because she lacks the maturity to interpret his love as violence. Billy’s instinct for self-preservation outpaces her own.
