When Heaven and Earth Changed Places: A Vietnamese Woman's Journey from War to Peace is a memoir of Le Ly Hayslip by Le Ly Hayslip and Jay Wurts that was first published in 1989. It uses a nonlinear structure to describe childhood, which is fractured by the Vietnam War, her fleeing to the United States, and her return to Vietnam 16 years later in 1986. When Heaven and Earth Changed Places and Hayslipâ€™s second memoir, Child of War, Woman of Peace (1993), were the basis of the 1993 film Heaven & Earth directed by Oliver Stone.
