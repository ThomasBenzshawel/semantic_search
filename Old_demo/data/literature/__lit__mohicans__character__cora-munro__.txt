The raven-haired daughter of Colonel Munro, Cora literally embodies
				the novel’s ambivalent opinion about mixed race. She is part “Negro,”
				a racial heritage portrayed as both unobjectionable and a cause
				for vitriolic defensiveness in her father. She becomes entangled
				with the Indian Uncas, a romantic complication portrayed both as
				passionate and natural and as doomed to failure. Dark and stoic
				in comparison to her sister Alice’s blonde girlishness, Cora is
				not the stereotypical nineteenth-century sentimental heroine. Though
				she carries the weight of the sentimental novel, she also provides
				the impetus for the adventure narrative, since her capture by Magua
				necessitates rescue missions. Cora brings together the adventure
				story’s warfare and intrigue and the sentimental novel’s romance
				and loss. With Cora, Cooper makes two genres intersect, creating
				the frontier romance.
