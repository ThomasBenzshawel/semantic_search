Though her family suspects she is shallow and empty-headed, Mashah is
				instead simply a lover of beauty. She buys paper flowers, makes a special trip
				to listen to the free music in the park, and lavishes attention on her face and
				figure simply because they are some of the few reliable sources of beauty
				available to her in her impoverished life. Sara says early in the book that
				Mashah seems to feed off her beauty the way other people feed off food, and the
				time she puts into keeping herself attractive is simply a way of keeping her
				food supply strong. She is first drawn to her great love, Jacob Novak, through
				the beautiful music he produces. She responds to that love by spreading beauty
				as far as she can: the house becomes cleaner and more organized, the table has
				fresh flowers, and the joy on her face brings light to all who know her. She
				puts so much effort into creating beauty for Jacobâ€™s sake that when he leaves,
				her belief in beauty itself is crushed. Her spirit slowly drains away. She still
				keeps herself looking nice, but there is no longer any heart behind
				it.
