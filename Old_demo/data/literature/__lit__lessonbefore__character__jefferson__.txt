The novel centers around Jefferson’s unjust conviction
				and his friends’ attempts to help him die with human dignity. A
				relatively simple man, Jefferson has spent his entire life on the
				plantation, working for poor wages. He has always worked without
				protest, believing that his place in the world is a lowly one. When
				Jefferson’s lawyer defends Jefferson by likening him to a mindless
				hog, Jefferson becomes terrified and infuriated, obsessed by the
				possibility that he really is no better than a hog. He rages in
				his cell, mimicking a hog’s behavior and jeering at his friends
				and family, or refusing to speak to them.

	When Grant visits Jefferson for the first time, Jefferson
				is so withdrawn and sullen that Grant thinks it will be impossible
				to help him. Jefferson does change with Grant’s help, however. He
				begins to believe in his own worth, and he realizes his life and
				manner of dying might have symbolic importance for his community.
				Gaines casts Jefferson as a Christ figure, a man to whom people
				look for their own salvation. Jefferson becomes brave and thoughtful,
				and his journal reveals the truth that even the most woefully uneducated man
				can possess depths of intelligence and lyricism.
