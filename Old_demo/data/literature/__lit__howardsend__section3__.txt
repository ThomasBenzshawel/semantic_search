					Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox go Christmas
					shopping together, and Margaret reflects on the
					muddiness and clumsiness of the Christmas holiday,
					thinking that it does a poor job of reflecting "the
					unseen."   In conversation, she reveals to Mrs.
					Wilcox that the Schlegels will be forced to move away
					from Wickham Place in two or three years. When the
					lease expires, the house will be torn down and replaced
					with flats.  Mrs. Wilcox is appalled, and invites
					Margaret to come to Howards End with her right then.
					Margaret, to Mrs. Wilcox's evident annoyance,
					declines.  After being dropped off at home, Margaret
					regrets her decision, and hurries to the train
					station.  She meets Mrs. Wilcox, who is thrilled that
					Margaret has changed her mind.  But just then, Mr.
					Wilcox and Evie arrive back from a drive in
					their car, having crashed the car and taken the
					train into London.  Mrs. Wilcox returns with them to
					their flat, leaving Margaret alone.
				


					Not long after, Mrs. Wilcox dies, and is buried near
					Howards End, in a service observed by many of the
					poor local villagers.  While the other Wilcoxes try
					to eat breakfast, Mr. Wilcox sits in his room
					remembering his wife's steady, unwavering goodness
					during their 30 years of marriage.  The others sit
					downstairs, the Wilcox children in a repressed state
					of mourning, and Charles' scatterbrained wife,
					Dolly, in a state of awkward boredom.  As Charles
					stomps about the garage, Dolly rushes out with a
					shocking piece of news:  Mrs. Wilcox has left Howards
					End to Margaret.  Charles and his father
					confer, and ultimately decide that Mrs. Wilcox
					cannot have meant it; they decide not to take any
					action based on the flimsy, handwritten note they
					were left.  Charles is quite critical of Margaret,
					saying that she is more German than
					English, but Mr. Wilcox, though admitting that he
					finds her tiresome, says that he is certain she is
					honest.
				


					Margaret, unbeknownst to the Wilcoxes, not only had
					nothing to do with Mrs. Wilcox's note, she did not
					even know about it.  She has grown very fond of the
					Wilcoxes, and actually feels quite protective of
					them.  When Mr. Wilcox sends her a trinket of Mrs.
					Wilcox's, she thinks that he is very generous.
					Helen returns from Stettin, having rejected a
					marriage proposal, and Tibby applies for a
					scholarship at Oxford.
				


					Two years pass.  Tibby enters Oxford, where he
					thrives--he does not make friends, but he loves the
					atmosphere.  Soon, Margaret realizes that the Wickham
					Place lease will expire in only nine months, and that
					they will have to find a new house.  She and Tibby
					discuss this when he is home on holiday, and also
					discuss what he plans to do with his life.  She thinks
					he should work, but he says that he does not want a
					career.  Helen runs in excitedly, saying that a
					bizarre woman has just called demanding to see her
					husband.  This gaudily dressed creature (obviously
					Jacky, having found the Schlegels' card in
					Leonard's books) refused to believe that her
					husband was not in the house.  The family tries to
					put the subject aside, but it lingers underneath
					their conversation.
				


					One of the remarkable stylistic features of Forster's
					novel is the way certain key images and phrases are
					repeated throughout it, forming a kind of symbolic
					shorthand for important thematic ideas.  (If one
					reads the novel over a long period of time, it is
					possible to miss this repetition entirely, but if one
					reads it quickly, the repeated phrases quickly begin
					to stick out.)  These phrases include:  "the outer
					world of telegrams and anger," used by the
					Schlegels to describe the pragmatic life of the
					Wilcoxes; the "goblins marching across the universe"
					that Helen perceives in the third and fourth
					movements of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Chapter 5,
					used to describe the feeling of desolation and
					meaninglessness that haunts the edges of the
					intellectual life and challenges the notion that
					humanity is capable of greatness; "plain question,
					plain answer," a notion used by the Wilcox men to
					imply that the truth is immediate and knowable, but
					rejected by Mrs. Wilcox as overly simplistic;
					and the relation of "the seen" to "the unseen," used
					by both Schlegel sisters to describe the conflict
					between the actual, material world and the world of
					ideals and spirit.
				


					The last concept emerges in Chapter 10 as
					Margaret thinks about the conflict between the
					practice of Christmas, with its materialism and its
					decoration, and the spiritual meaning of Christmas.
					The idea recurs throughout the novel, until Helen
					finally concludes that it is only the idea of death
					that makes "the unseen" relevant:  If people lived
					forever, life would be all money and toil, but
					because people know that they must die, they are
					interested in meaning.  The motif of the goblins
					reappears in Chapter 13
					when it is used to describe the Schlegels' lingering
					sense of Jacky's abhorrent presence, which, like a
					goblin footfall, gives Margaret an idea of the abyss
					of poverty and desolation from which she is separated
					only by money.
