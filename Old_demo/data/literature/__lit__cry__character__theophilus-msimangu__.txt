Msimangu is warm, generous, and humble young minister
				in Sophiatown. He guides both Kumalo and us through Johannesburg, explaining
				the political and socioeconomic difficulties that the black population
				faces and providing shrewd commentary on both blacks and whites.
				He assists Kumalo with great sensitivity, working to spare him pain
				when he can and arranging time for him to rest. In general, he makes
				Kumalo’s time in Johannesburg bearable.

Of all the characters in the novel, Msimangu has the clearest understanding
				of South Africa’s injustices, and he serves as Paton’s mouthpiece
				in suggesting a solution: Christian love. According to Msimangu,
				white South Africans oppress the blacks because they fear their
				numbers and their power. Msimangu believes that only selfless love
				can counter this fear. Msimangu’s own selflessness is affirmed at
				the novel’s close, when he gives his worldly possessions to Kumalo
				and joins a monastery.
