Although Homais is not central to the plot of Madame
					Bovary, he is an absolutely essential part of its atmosphere.
				He is a pompous speechmaker, endlessly rattling on about medical
				techniques and theories that he really knows nothing about. His
				presence serves, in part, to heighten our sense of Emma’s frustration
				with her life. Flaubert relates Homais’s speeches in full, forcing
				us to read them just as Emma is forced to listen to them. Homais
				is also an extremely selfish man. When the Bovarys first arrive
				in Yonville, we learn that he is only befriending Charles because
				he wants Charles to turn a blind eye to his disreputable medical
				practices.

	In the last sentence of the book, Homais receives the
				Legion of Honor, a medal he has always dreamed of attaining, after
				Emma and Charles are both dead. Meanwhile, Charles—who loved his wife
				as deeply as he was capable—and Emma—who yearned to live an exceptional
				life—are both punished. By rewarding Homais, Flaubert does not advocate
				his kind of life. Instead, he shows us a realistic portrayal of
				one of the most disappointing aspects of the world—that the mediocre
				and the selfish often fare better than either those who live passionately
				and try to be exceptional or those who live humbly and treat others
				with kind generosity.
