Natasha is one of Tolstoy’s grandest creations, a representation
				of joyful vitality and the ability to experience life fully and
				boldly. The antithesis of Helene Kuragina, her eventual husband’s
				first wife, Natasha is as lively and spontaneous as Helene is stony
				and scheming. From infancy to adulthood, Natasha charms everyone
				who meets her, from the guests of the Rostovs who witness her unintelligible
				comments about her doll, to Andrew Bolkonski, Anatole Kuragin, and
				finally Pierre Bezukhov. Yet, despite her charms, Natasha never
				comes across as a show-off or a flirt angling for men’s attentions.
				Whether running in the fields in a yellow dress, singing on her
				balcony at Otradnoe, or simply sitting in an opera box, Natasha
				inspires desire simply by being herself, by existing in her own
				unique way. Her simplicity sometimes makes her naïve, however, as
				when she misunderstands her momentary passion for Anatole and makes
				absurd plans to elope with him. But Natasha repents her error with
				a sincerity that elicits forgiveness even from the wronged Andrew
				on his deathbed. Natasha’s spiritual development is not as philosophical
				or bookish as Pierre’s, but it is just as profound. She changes
				radically by the end of the novel, growing wise in a way that makes
				her Pierre’s spiritual equal.
