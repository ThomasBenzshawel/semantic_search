Nector dominates the novel nearly as much as his wife, but unlike Marie, he never seems to learn or change, except for in his senility. He begins his life torn between two women, Lulu and Marie, and ends in this relational tug-of-war, too. Nector compares his life to a river, especially the seventeen years that flow by with Marie that he calls “water under the bridge,” years in which he keeps his eyes straight ahead. When he does look to the side, he sees Lulu, and he lacks the courage to say no to a relationship with her. Lulu makes him feel younger and passionate, and he gives in to lust, which he equates with true love.

Even when Nector accidentally sets fire to Lulu’s house and nearly kills their son Lyman, he does not change. Lipsha observes that Marie has a mid-life inner growth spurt, but Nector shrinks. Marie grows and learns while Nector fades. Even in his dementia, he crudely propositions Marie for sex, and while Marie loves him, she also grieves for the man he once was. When God doesn’t seem to hear his prayers, Nector shouts louder rather than take responsibility. His last words to Lipsha are about snapping turtles who can live after their heads are cut off, declaring, “Their brain’s just in their heart, like yours is.” Nector doesn’t seem to have much of a heart, so Lipsha’s “love medicine” kills him.
