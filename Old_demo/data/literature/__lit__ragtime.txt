Ragtime, first published in 1975, is a historical fiction novel by E. L. Doctorow that weaves a tapestry of intersecting lives in early 20th-century America. Set against the backdrop of historical events, the novel tells the stories of three families–an upper-class family in New Rochelle, an immigrant and his daughter, and a ragtime pianist and his beloved. Through vibrant characters and vivid prose, Doctorow explores themes of social upheaval, racism, and the American Dream. Ragtime was adapted into a movie in 1981 directed by Milos Forman.
