Jurgis has to stay in prison for three extra days because
					he lacks the money to pay the cost of his trial. When he is released,
					he walks twenty miles to his home in Packingtown. He discovers a
					new family living in his home. He visits Grandmother Majauszkiene,
					who informs him that his family could not pay the rent. The agent
					evicted them and sold the house within a week. She
					gives him the address of the boarding house where they stayed when
					they first arrived in Chicago.

Jurgis trudges off toward the old boarding house, feeling defeated
					and reflecting on how he and his family have been unjustly treated.
					As the widow stands in the open door, Jurgis hears Ona screaming,
					and he tears through the house. He hears her in a garret; as he
					is about to ascend the ladder to the garret, however, Marija tries
					to stop him. She tells him that the Ona’s baby is coming—Ona has
					gone into premature labor. Unable to stand Ona’s horrible cries, Jurgis
					scrounges together a dollar and a quarter from the widow and other
					women in her kitchen in order to get help for Ona.

Jurgis runs to the apartment of a Dutch midwife, Madame
					Haupt, and begs her to attend to Ona. She asks for twenty-five dollars;
					after trying unsuccessfully to make her understand that he has neither money
					nor friends with money, Jurgis heads down the stairs. Madame Haupt
					finally agrees to go for the dollar and a quarter that Jurgis does
					have. Marija and the widow turn Jurgis out for the night, telling
					him that he will only be in the way. He goes to a saloon that he
					used to frequent, and the saloonkeeper provides him food, drink,
					and a place to rest. At four o’clock in the morning, Jurgis returns
					to the boardinghouse and sees Madame Haupt descend from the garret
					covered in blood. She informs him that the baby is dead and that
					Ona is dying. Jurgis rushes up to find a priest praying near the
					withered Ona. She recognizes him for an instant and then dies. In
					the morning, Kotrina appears and Jurgis demands to know where she
					has been. She replies that she has been out selling papers with
					the boys. Jurgis takes three dollars from her and proceeds to a nearby
					bar to get drunk.

When Jurgis is sober, Teta Elzbieta begs him to remember
					Antanas. Jurgis rouses himself to look for work for his son’s sake
					if nothing else. But he soon learns that he is blacklisted in Packingtown.
					Phil Connor has made certain that he will never find another job
					there. Marija’s hand will soon be healed enough for her to return
					to work, however, and Teta Elzbieta has a lead on a job scrubbing
					floors.

After two weeks of futile searching and odd jobs, Jurgis
					meets an old acquaintance from his union. The man leads him to a
					factory where harvesting machines are produced, and the foreman
					gives Jurgis a job. The working conditions are much better,
					and the factory is a paragon of philanthropy and goodwill. Nevertheless,
					workers still must keep up a breakneck speed. Jurgis regains hope
					and begins to make plans, even studying English at night. Several
					days later, however, a placard at the factory informs the men who
					work there that Jurgis’s department will be closed until further
					notice.

Only the children’s wages keep the family from starvation
					while Jurgis spends more than ten days looking for another job.
					Juozapas, Teta Elzbieta’s crippled child, begins to go to the local
					dump to find food. A rich woman finds him there and asks
					him about his life. Hearing of the tragedy and penury that pursues
					the family, she visits them at the boardinghouse. Shocked at the
					squalor in which they live, she resolves to find Jurgis a job. She
					is engaged to be married to a superintendent at a steel mill, so
					she writes a letter of recommendation for Jurgis. Jurgis takes the
					letter to the superintendent and gets himself hired.

The mill is too far for Jurgis to return to the boardinghouse
					during the week, so he travels home only on the weekends. He loves
					his son with an overwhelming devotion. Antanas’s first attempts
					at speech provide no end of delight to Jurgis. Jurgis begins to
					read the Sunday paper with the help of the children and settles
					in a livable routine. But he returns to the boardinghouse one day
					only to discover that a freak accident has occurred: Antanas has
					drowned in the mire of mud in the streets.

The narrative shape of The Jungle is
					extremely simple: it exposes the fallacy of the American Dream by
					portraying the gradual destruction of the immigrant family at the
					hands of the forces of capitalism. Every section, every chapter,
					and nearly every individual event throughout most of the book operates
					according to this plan. In this section, not surprisingly, the family
					continues to suffer greater and greater misfortunes. Their
					home, the symbol of family life, has been taken from them; the building
					looks as if the family never even lived there. Jurgis’s return to
					his home is a metaphor for the cyclical nature of generations of
					immigrants. These waves of immigrants pass through Packingtown and
					its misery—the only constant in their lives.

Moreover, the second- and third-generation children of
					earlier waves of immigrants seem to forget that their ancestors
					suffered the very same abuses that they now perpetrate on the newer
					generations of immigrants. As theories about eugenics (a science
					concerned with improving a specific race’s hereditary qualities)
					arose in the late nineteenth century, making claims about the inherent
					inferiority of nonwhite peoples and white peoples of certain descent,
					Americans became hostile toward the waves of immigrants whom they
					perceived as infiltrators spoiling the purity of the American people.
					The first waves were constituted largely of northern and western
					Europeans. The Irish, then, stereotyped as potato-eating drunks,
					were among the early targets of ridicule. With the arrival of later
					waves of immigrants, largely from southern and eastern Europe, these
					earlier immigrants sought to take advantage of these new immigrants.
					Phil Connor, for example, an Irishman, takes part in the abuse and
					degradation that, a few decades earlier, the Irish suffered at the
					hands of more powerful ethnic groups. Historical memory is short
					if not nonexistent in The Jungle.


These chapters also function as the next stage of Sinclair’s
					attack on capitalism. Earlier, he shows that child labor laws do
					nothing to stop child labor, implying that it is not possible to
					improve working conditions and labor practices from within the structures
					of capitalism. Jurgis’s job at the harvester factory expounds upon
					the same idea. The factory supposedly functions according to philanthropic values,
					and the facilities are cleaner and the working conditions more pleasant.
					Nevertheless, the factory shuts down periodically after the rush
					season just like other factories, leaving thousands of laborers
					without the income necessary to survive. The factory’s philanthropic
					values do nothing to change the essentially precarious existence
					of wage laborers. Again, working from within capitalism fails to
					provide wage laborers with a secure, decent living.

The young woman who secures Jurgis a job with her recommendation
					shows compassion in an otherwise cruel world. However, her actions
					do nothing to change the dangerous working conditions in the steel
					factory where her fiancé is a superintendent—Jurgis witnesses several
					men suffer horrendous, disabling accidents in the steel mill. Neither
					does her kind action make a difference in the dangerous conditions
					in the slums where wage laborers live. She helps Jurgis secure an
					income, but Antanas still drowns in the unpaved, muddy streets outside
					the boarding house. Through this example, Sinclair argues, pessimistically,
					that individual philanthropists working within the structures of
					capitalism are likewise ineffective at changing the lives of wage
					laborers for the better.
