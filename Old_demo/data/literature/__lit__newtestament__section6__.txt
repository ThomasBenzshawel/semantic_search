Of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament, fourteen
					have traditionally been attributed to the great missionary Paul
					of Tarsus. These fourteen books all take the form of letters addressed
					to a given individual or community. In the traditional canonical
					ordering of the New Testament, these fourteen books are arranged
					in a block following Acts, and separated into three groups: the
					nine letters addressed to communities, the four letters addressed
					to individuals, and Hebrews. Within each grouping, the traditional
					canonical system orders the books according to length. Thus, a traditional
					New Testament arrangement will list the books as follows: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians,
					Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy,
					Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews. This SparkNote addresses
					only a few of the most important letters: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians,
					and Ephesians. Modern scholars agree with the traditional second-century
					Christian belief that seven of these New Testament letters were
					almost certainly written by Paul himself: 1 Thessalonians,
					Galatians, Philippians, Philemon, 1 and 2 Corinthians,
					and Romans. These letters were most likely written during the height
					of Paul’s missionary activity, between 50 and 58 a.d.,
					making them the earliest surviving Christian documents—they predate
					the earliest of the Gospels, Mark, by at least ten years.

During the winter of 57–58 a.d.,
					Paul was in the Greek city of Corinth. From Corinth, he wrote the
					longest single letter in the New Testament, which he addressed to
					“God’s beloved in Rome” (1:7). Like
					most New Testament letters, this letter is known by the name of the
					recipients, the Romans. Paul’s letters tended to be written in response
					to specific crises. For instance, 1 Corinthians
					was written to reprove the Christian community in Corinth for its
					internal divisions and for its immoral sexual practices. But Romans
					is remarkably devoid of this kind of specificity, addressing broad
					questions of theology rather than specific questions of contemporary
					practice. Whereas other Pauline letters—2 Corinthians,
					for instance—are full of impassioned rhetoric and personal pleas,
					Romans is written in a solemn and restrained tone. Perhaps this
					solemnity can be explained by timing: Romans was the last written
					of the seven New Testament letters that modern scholars attribute
					to Paul, and has been seen as a summary of Paul’s thought, composed
					as his career moved toward its conclusion. But it is also true that,
					as opposed to the Corinthian church, the Roman church was
					not founded by Paul himself. At the time when he wrote Romans, Paul
					had never visited Rome, although Chapter 16 of
					Romans does indicate that he had acquaintances there. Writing to
					a community largely composed of strangers, then, Paul may have felt
					compelled to use the restrained and magisterial declarations of
					Roman style, rather than the impassioned pleas and parental sternness
					that permeate his letters to the churches at Corinth.

Because he is not personally familiar with the Roman church,
					Paul begins his letter by introducing himself. He has been “called
					to be an apostle,” and his mission is “to bring about the obedience
					of faith among all the Gentiles” (1:1–5).
					Paul follows his introduction with a flattering greeting to the
					Roman church, and expresses his desire to preach in Rome someday.
					Paul gives a summary of the theme of his letter: “The Gospel . .
					. is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to
					the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness
					of God is revealed through faith for faith” (1:16–17).

Paul begins with a discussion of the state of humanity
					before the possibility of salvation through faith in Jesus. He tells
					how Gentiles worshipped idols, disdaining devotion to God, and how
					Jews failed to follow the law properly, acting hypocritically by
					proclaiming allegiance to Jewish law while surreptitiously sinning.
					Paul says that God’s ancestral promise to the Jews, symbolized by
					circumcision, does not bring automatic salvation: “A person is a
					Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the
					heart—it is spiritual” (2:29).
					Paul concludes, “We have already charged that all, both Jews and
					Greeks, are under the power of sin” (3:9).

Paul teaches that salvation from sin is only possible
					through faith. Paul cites the example of the biblical patriarch
					Abraham, who received God’s blessing and passed it on to his descendents
					through “the righteousness of faith” (4:13).
					The free gift of grace, Paul continues, unearned and undeserved,
					is a product of God’s love manifested toward the unworthy. Whereas
					Adam’s fall brought sin and death into the world, Jesus’s sacrifice
					brought grace and life. The importance of baptism, Paul explains,
					is that baptism initiates a new life of grace and purity: the sinner
					symbolically dies, baptized into the death of Jesus, and the person
					who emerges is “dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” (6:11).
					Christians, then, must be governed by holiness, not by sin: holiness
					alone will lead to eternal life. Jewish law ceases to be binding:
					the law arouses sinful passions, and as beings dead to
					sin, Christians become dead to the law. Paul urges the Romans to
					live not “according to the flesh” but rather by the Spirit (8:4).
					Through the Spirit, all believers become spiritual children of God,
					called by God to glory. This potential is a source of strength for the
					Christian: “If God is for us, who is against us?” (8:31).

Paul’s next topic is the problem of reconciling the doctrine
					of salvation through faith in Christ with the Old Testament promise
					of the salvation of the Jewish people. This section begins with
					a lamentation, as Paul, who was himself born a Jew, expresses his
					wish to help the Israelites, the supposed firstborn children of
					God. But he goes on to explain that the Christian covenant of grace
					is by no means a betrayal of Abraham’s covenant with God. Those
					who have faith in Jesus, who believe “with the heart,” are “children
					of the promise,” the spiritual children of Israel (10:10, 9:8).
					The genetic children of Israel, the Jews, stumbled when they mistook
					Jewish law for the means to salvation. But the Jews have not been
					entirely cast aside. Paul teaches that eventually the Jews will
					come to express faith in Jesus, enabling God to keep his original
					promise to them.

Finished with his exposition of Christian doctrine, Paul
					embarks upon a lengthy exhortation to the Romans, advising them
					on the proper means of living a Christian life. Harmony, humility,
					and love are his main concerns. He urges charity, forbearance, and
					submission. Paul returns to the apocalyptic theme on which he dwells
					in his other letters. He says that it is doubly important to act
					righteously in an apocalyptic age. In a long segment, Paul mandates
					tolerance and freedom of religious conscience within the church.
					The strong in faith are not to judge and reject the weak in faith—that
					is, those who have given up Jewish law are to accept the observances
					of those who continue to practice Jewish law. Paul finishes this
					section with a set of Old Testament quotations about the worship
					of God spreading among all nations. Paul concludes his letter with
					a section in which he discusses his own ministry, proving his authority
					through a discussion of his credentials: “I have reason to boast
					of my work for God” (15:17).
					He informs the Romans that he is preparing to bring the contributions
					of the Greek and Macedonian churches to Jerusalem, where he speculates
					that he might run into difficulties. Chapter 16 contains
					a long list of greetings, which many scholars believe were added
					by a later editor. Paul sends the greetings to the Roman Christians,
					warning the Romans to be wary of “those who cause dissensions and
					offenses” (16:17).

The period during which Paul wrote his letters was traumatic
					for the new church. Christianity had not yet evolved into a distinct
					religion with a hierarchy of authority and a defined dogma. Christianity,
					in its earliest years, was an offshoot of Judaism. Believers in
					Jesus, including all of the Twelve Apostles, were generally born
					Jewish and identified themselves as Jews who believed that the Old
					Testament prophecies had reached their fulfillment in Jesus.
					Indeed, the term “Christians” did not appear until Paul’s ministry
					at Antioch, decades after Jesus’s crucifixion. The church was not
					a single, unified body governed by a central authority, but, rather,
					a conglomeration of individual communities, often separated by large
					distances, which depended for spiritual authority on local preachers
					or traveling missionaries, like Paul. Christians in the decades
					after Jesus lived in constant fear of persecution and constant expectation
					of the second coming, Jesus’s triumphant return to Earth during which
					he would save the faithful.

The letters that Paul wrote respond to these conditions
					of the early church. He addresses them to specific communities,
					most of which had been established by Paul himself. In an era when
					travel was slow and long-distance communication was difficult, Paul’s
					letters were a means of preserving his spirit in a community once
					he had left, or of instructing a community from a distance. The
					aim of the letters was to inspire unity among believers and to instruct
					the faithful on difficult points of doctrine. The letters are highly
					individualized, responding to the specific problems of the community
					to which they are addressed. By and large, with the possible exception of
					the letter to the Romans, Paul’s letters show little evidence that they
					were intended to endure as permanent documents. Paul, like other
					early Christians, expected an imminent Second Coming, and he wrote
					his letters to address immediate problems rather than to establish
					a lasting apparatus to perpetuate the church.

The four Gospels can be viewed as a history of the birth
					of faith. The Gospels all follow a similar pattern. They describe
					Jesus working miracles and preaching, but failing to convince many
					people of his divinity until his resurrection. The triumphant moment
					in the Gospels comes when the apostles witness the reborn Jesus
					and have their faith confirmed. The entire story of the Gospels
					is designed to stress the importance of faith for the Christian.
					Indeed, practically the only factor that separated these early Christians
					from the nonbelieving Jews was faith in Jesus. Nowhere in the Gospels,
					however, is the opposition between faith and law made so clear as
					in Romans. Paul elevates the role of faith, describing it as the
					sole means by which people can attain salvation. Through Jesus’s
					self-sacrifice, Paul teaches, God gave men the free gift of a covenant
					of salvation. It is only by faith in Jesus that one attains salvation.
