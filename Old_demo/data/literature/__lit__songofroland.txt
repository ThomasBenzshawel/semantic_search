The Song of Roland is an epic poem that recounts the heroic deeds of Roland, a knight in Charlemagne’s army, as he battles against the Saracens in Spain. The poem was likely composed in the early 12th century and is the oldest surviving major work of French literature. It is loosely inspired by the historical Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778, but the poem’s portrayal of Charlemagne and the events of the battle are highly fictionalized. Filled with themes of loyalty, honor, and religious conflict, the poem is a classic of chivalric literature.
