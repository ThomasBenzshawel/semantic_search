Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You is the 2020 adaptation of historian Ibram X. Kendi’s 2017 award-winning book, Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America. Crafted from Kendi’s work by award-winning novelist Jason Reynolds as what he calls a “remix,” Stamped is directed at readers aged 12 and up. Reynolds futher describes Stamped as “not a history book,” though it essentially provides a history of the racist beliefs that have shaped American culture. Written in an engaging, conversational style geared toward young adults, Stamped calls readers to reject racism and embrace antiracist principles. Other adaptations of Kendi’s original 2017 work include a book for even younger readers as well as a 2023 Netflix documentary entitled Stamped from the Beginning.
