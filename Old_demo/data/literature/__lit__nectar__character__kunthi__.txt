Although Kunthi and Rukmani are neighbors in similar circumstances, Kunthi
				chooses a very different life path. Where Rukmani remains a faithful wife,
				Kunthi is unfaithful even as a young bride. She uses her beauty and her
				seductiveness first to lure Nathan and later to attract the attention of the
				young tannery workers. For Kunthi, the tannery means a town with excitement and
				luxuries, whereas for Rukmani, it represents the repudiation of beauty, health,
				and values. Kunthi transfers her own morality to Rukmani by assuming that
				Rukmani and Kenny are conducting an illicit affair. At first she merely
				threatens Rukmani with exposure, but as her conditions becomes more dire, Kunthi
				extorts food from both Rukmani and Nathan. Her power comes from their fear and
				is so strong and evil that Rukmani and Nathan risk their familyâ€™s starvation to
				satisfy her. Rukmani and Nathan finally break her power with truth. Truth is the
				transcendent Hindu value, and Kunthi stands in opposition to it.
