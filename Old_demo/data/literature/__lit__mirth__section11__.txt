The House of Mirth is a novel about the
personal struggle to fit into society and, ultimately, to get married.
This places the book in a long-standing literary tradition known
as the novel of manners, a form developed most notably by Sir Walter
Scott and Jane Austen. Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Sense
and Sensibility are pioneer works of this literary genre.
The tradition developed in England throughout the 19th
century, as authors such as George Eliot and Henry James explored
the place of women in society and the social effect of marriage,
showing in particular the problems that come with marriage and conforming
to society. In America, the novel of manners genre has included
works such as Hannah Foster's The Coquette, the
novels of James, Catherine Maria Sedgwick, and even Kate Chopin's The
Awakening.


The form developed some specific conventions in the 19th
century. First, the protagonist is usually a single woman looking
to get married. Second, socio-economic class must be a factor in
determining whom the woman will marry. Third, the novel must include many
scenes that portray the proper and improper way to act within high
society, and also outline differences and relations between classes.
And finally, the novel of manners usually ends with either the marriage
or death of the female protagonist. Austen's Sense and Sensibility is
a good example of this form. The protagonist, Elinor, is looking
to get married, preferably to someone of a higher social class,
and after many scenes of London society seen in dinner parties and
elegant balls, Elinor marries Edward Ferrars. Foster's The Coquette has
the same elements, but it ends in the death of the female protagonist.

During the late 19th century, the
novel of manners was one of the most popular novel genres, but it
was also a predominantly British form. Many people questioned whether
such a genre could exist in America, where there are no official
social classes. Wharton, as we can see, adapted the form in her
own way to better suit the New York society. Instead of a legitimized
aristocracy, Wharton creates a social circle comprised of elegant
New York snobs. Class mobility, not present in most British manners
novels, is a large factor in The House of Mirth, which
shows the attempts of Lily to assimilate herself into the elite
group, only to slide down the social scale into the working class
before her death. In fact, Lily's primary goal is not to marry for
happiness, as is seen in many Austen characters, but rather for
social security. A marriage to Percy Gryce, Lily decides at the
beginning of the novel, would be the best way to assure herself
of good social standing and a steady income.


The House of Mirth also examines the
long physical and mental decline of a young woman who, because of
her own cowardice and indecision, slips out of social prominence
into poverty and dinginess. The novel presents a very harsh dose
of reality and ends rather pathetically. Instead of marrying and
living happily ever after, or tragically dying during childbirth
(the two most common endings in the genre), Lily fades away slowly
and commits suicide, perhaps unintentionally, as a means of escaping
from a lower-class world in which her upper-class sensibilities
cannot survive. Lily's life is the antithesis of nobility or glory;
she had every opportunity to live the type of life she dreamed about,
but lost it all.

Wharton's manipulation of the genre makes the novel a
good example of the American realism movement, which began roughly after
Reconstruction (the late 1870s)
and lasted until just after World War I (the early 1920s).
The English novel of manners was developed during the Romanticism
movement, which placed a literary emphasis on emotion rather than
reason, and the ideal rather than reality. Realism, to which Wharton
subscribed, grew out of Darwinist ideas of natural selection and
survival of the fittest. To Wharton, the existing novel of manners
had not adequately dealt with the fall from society that many people
in New York experienced if they ran out of money or did not marry
well. The House of Mirth, then, can perhaps best
be viewed as an attempt to add a very dark truth to an otherwise
optimistic genre, an attempt consistent with the literary spirit
of the time in which Wharton was writing.
