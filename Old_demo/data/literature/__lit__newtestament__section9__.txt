The Book of Revelation is strikingly different from the
					rest of the New Testament. It is populated by winged and wild creatures, locust
					plagues, and seven-headed beasts. Revelation is filled with obscure
					and fantastic symbolism, and it teems with mystical references.
					However, it lacks any real internal structure. Unlike the other New
					Testament books, which tend to mix narrative with sermon-style
					preaching, Revelation is essentially a long, uninterrupted record of
					a mystical vision, offering little interpretation for its intricate
					symbols. Revelation has been read for thousands of years as a code
					that, properly interpreted, can reveal the secrets of history and
					the end of the world. The numbers and symbols in Revelation have
					been read into any number of traumatic events in ancient and modern
					history.

Revelation was a product of this time of early growth
					and confusion, but also of a long Jewish tradition of apocalyptic
					literature. The Old Testament books of Ezekiel and Zechariah contain
					long apocalyptic segments. The most famous Old Testament apocalypse, the
					Book of Daniel, was written circa 165 b.c. The apocalyptic genre became more popular after 70 a.d.,
					when the apocryphal apocalypses, 2 Baruch
					and 4 Ezra, were written in response to the destruction
					of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem by Roman armies. There is enough
					apocalyptic literature that it can be classified as a genre of its
					own, with its own particular characteristics. Some of these common
					features are revelations made to a human emissary through a supernatural
					agency, heavy symbolism, numerology with obscure significance, extravagant
					imagery, and concern about a cataclysmic day of judgment or the
					end of the world. Apocalyptic literature tends to take a deterministic
					view of history—that is, apocalypses are generally driven by the
					belief that history inexorably follows a set path ordained by God.
					All of these characteristics of the apocalyptic genre are present
					in Revelation.

The introduction of Revelation names the author, John,
					and explains the immediacy of the message: the end of days is at
					hand. John extends a greeting to the Christian communities in seven
					major Near East cities in the name of the God of history. On the
					Sabbath, John falls into a prophetic ecstasy. He sees a vision of
					a shining Jesus, surrounded by seven stars and seven lamp-stands:
					these represent the seven churches of Asia. In 2:1–3:22,
					John is given orders to deliver a message to each of the churches,
					addressing specific strengths and failings of each church, providing
					encouragement to some and driving others to repent before Judgment
					Day. Jesus reminds them that his coming is imminent. The first half
					of John’s revelatory experience begins with the opening of the heavenly
					door: “Come up here,” a voice calls to him, “I will show you what
					is to take place in the future” (4:1).
					John sees God enthroned and surrounded by twenty-four elders.

Lightning flashes and thunder sounds. Old Testament angels with
					six wings and many eyes sing praises to the Lord. God holds a scroll
					sealed with seven seals, and nobody is worthy of breaking the seals
					except Jesus, by virtue of his sacrifice. Jesus appears here as
					“a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered,” but also as “the
					Lion of the tribe of Judah” (5:5–6).
					Breaking the first four seals, Jesus releases the Four
					Horsemen of the Apocalypse: victory, war, famine, and pestilence.
					When the fifth seal is broken, the souls of martyrs cry out for
					justice, but they are urged to have patience until the appointed number
					of people have been martyred. The breaking of the sixth seal unleashes
					a massive cosmic upheaval that devastates the world. 

Before the breaking of the seventh seal, an angel marks 144,000 people—12,000 from
					each of the tribes of Israel—with the seal of God to protect them
					from the coming devastation. Other righteous people, too, are to
					be saved: a “great multitude . . . [of people] from all the tribes
					and peoples and languages” have cleansed themselves and they, too,
					will be protected (7:9).
					Finally, it is time to open the seventh seal (8:1).
					But the opening of the seal is anticlimactic; when it is opened,
					it is revealed that there are seven trumpets that need to be blown.
					Four of the trumpets blow, each bringing with it disaster and destruction,
					with fire falling from the sky (8:6–12).
					With the fifth trumpet, the chimney leading out of the Abyss is
					unlocked, and bizarre locusts emerge in the smoke, stinging
					anyone unmarked by God’s seal. The sixth trumpet unleashes a vast
					troop of cavalry who kill “a third of humankind” (9:18).
					However, the survivors nevertheless refuse to stop worshipping idols
					and behaving immorally. An angel descends from heaven, announcing
					the imminent fulfillment of “the mystery of God” with the blowing
					of the seventh trumpet (10:7).

The prophet is ordered to consume a scroll, which will
					taste sweet but be bitter in his stomach (8:10).
					He is told that two prophets will arise to preach the word of God
					in Jerusalem, but will be killed after 1,260 days
					by “the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit” (11:7).
					God will revive these prophets, and will strike Jerusalem with a
					powerful earthquake. Finally, the seventh trumpet blows, and John
					hears voices shouting, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom
					of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign forever and ever”
					(11:15). The moment
					for justice, punishment, and triumph has arrived, with lighting,
					thunder, earthquakes, and hail.

The second half of Revelation begins with the opening
					of God’s sanctuary in heaven. A woman “clothed with the sun, with
					the moon under her feet,” gives birth to a child who is almost
					eaten by a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns (12:1).
					The child is saved from the dragon and brought to heaven. The archangel Michael
					makes war on the dragon, who is Satan, defeats him, and drives him
					from heaven. The dragon continues to pursue the woman, who yet again
					escapes him. Instead, he makes war on her children. The dragon delegates
					his power to a fantastical creature identified only as “the beast,”
					who makes war on the saints and curses God (13:4).
					A false prophet, “another beast,” arises and convinces people to
					worship the first beast (13:11).
					The prophet sees Jesus and his 144,000 righteous
					followers entrenched on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. He hears the news
					that the Day of Judgment is at hand, and that Babylon the Great—probably
					symbolic of the Roman Empire—has fallen. Angels begin to spill out
					of the blood of the wicked like wine from a winepress. While the
					righteous sing hymns to Moses and Jesus, seven angels empty seven
					bowls of plagues across the Earth, bringing suffering and destruction
					to the wicked. People refuse to repent, and instead curse God. With
					the pouring out of the seventh bowl, “it is done” (16:17).

John is shown a vision of the Whore of Babylon, who symbolizes the
					Roman Empire. An angel announces the fall of Babylon and warns God’s
					faithful to abandon Rome, lest they be punished together with the
					wicked. Those wicked people who made their livings from Rome’s trade
					will mourn her downfall, but the righteous will rejoice. Many voices
					surrounding the throne of God sing his praises at the news, and
					announce that the Lamb, Jesus, is soon to be wedded to his “bride,”
					the faithful of God (19:7).
					John is ordered to write the wedding announcement: “Blessed are
					those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb” (19:9).
					In the final battle, the gates of heaven open, and Jesus, clad now
					as a warrior named “Faithful and True,” leads the hosts of heaven
					in a war against the beast and the kings of the Earth (19:11).
					The beast and his false prophet are hurled into a fiery lake, and
					the other opponents of Jesus are killed. Together with the saints,
					Jesus reigns for 1,000 glorious
					years. At the end of the 1,000 years,
					Satan gathers his forces, Gog and Magog, and again leads them into
					battle against the saints, but they are consumed by fire. Satan,
					too, is hurled into the fiery pit. On the Day of Judgment, which
					follows immediately, everyone is resurrected and judged “according
					to their works” (20:12).
					After Judgment Day, John sees a vision of “a new heaven and a new
					earth,” and a new holy city of Jerusalem descended from heaven (21:1).
					The New Jerusalem is a picture of shining perfection, carved of
					precious stones and lit by the glory of God and Jesus, who are present
					in Jerusalem instead of a temple. John is commanded to publicize
					the vision that he has received: “Do not seal up the words of the
					prophesy of this book, for the time is near” (22:10).
					In the conclusion of Revelation, Jesus himself promises that God
					will come soon to reward the righteous and punish the wicked.

The Book of Revelation was probably written sometime between 81 and 89 a.d. by
					a man named John, in and around the cities in Asia Minor. Some scholars
					contend that Revelation indeed talks about the future, but it primarily
					seeks to understand the present, a time that was almost certainly
					one of extreme stress for Christians. Revelation itself indicates
					that John understood that a persecution of Christians living in
					western Asia Minor was imminent, and that the persecution would come
					from the Romans, who would make demands for emperor worship that
					the Christians would have to resist. John’s revelation is an attempt
					to persuade the small churches to turn away from imperial cult worship
					and toward the true God, who was in charge of history and who will
					triumph in the end. Revelation seeks to accommodate the contradiction
					of the triumph of God in history with the continued oppressive rule
					of the Romans.

Revelation’s heavy use of imagination and provocative
					symbolism is central to its rhetorical power. Revelation turns to
					poetics and aesthetics to depict the imperial city of Rome as a
					beast, stating that “its feet were like a bear’s and its mouth was
					like a lion’s mouth” (13:2).
					The beast has ten horns and seven heads and carries on its back
					“Babylon the great, mother of whores, and of the earth’s abominations”
					(17:5). Babylon, who
					is “drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses
					to Jesus,” represents the Roman Empire (17:6).
					She is eventually judged by the more powerful God, who causes her
					fall in Revelation’s climax: “He has judged the great whore who
					corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on
					her the blood of his servants. . . . Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
					great!” (14:8, 19:2).

John’s potent imagery is not only a “call for the endurance
					and faith of the saints” (13:10),
					but it also tries to move the audience to a decision to turn away
					from the beast “so that you do not take part in her sins” (18:4),
					and instead to turn toward the God of justice who “will wipe away
					every tear from their eyes” (21:4).
					Revelation persuades Christians to stake their lives on that decision.
					In Babylon, everything is for sale. John does not hedge about the
					immorality of such disparities between the rich and the poor. When
					Babylon is destroyed, neither God, Christ, the saints, the apostles,
					nor the prophets mourn. Those who are upset are “the merchants of
					the earth” (18:11)
					and “all whose trade is on the sea” (18:17).
					In addition, “the kings of the earth, who committed fornication
					and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail” (18:9).
