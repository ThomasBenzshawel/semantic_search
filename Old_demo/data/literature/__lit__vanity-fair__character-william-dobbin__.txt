Dobbin’s key traits are loyalty, steadfastness, and generosity, and he displays all these characteristics throughout his lasting friendships with both George and Amelia. Dobbin is also unselfish to the extreme, for example, allowing Amelia to credit George with buying the piano and then instigating their marriage. Dobbin does so out of his love for Amelia, which leads him to sacrifice his chance of happiness for hers. He also continually works behind the scenes to ensure her and Georgy’s safety and financial well-being. In this manner, Dobbin emerges as a true gentleman despite his low birth, ungainly appearance, and general awkwardness.

Dobbin rejects any possibility of happiness with a woman who is not Amelia. No woman could ever hope to compare to her. Instead, Dobbin secretly carries his feelings for Amelia for 18 years until he can no longer take the weight of being in love with someone unworthy of it. Dobbin returns to mainland Europe in response to a letter from Amelia before she had let go of her fantasy version of George, which shows that he can’t let go of his role as protector. At the end of the novel, Dobbin finds love and happiness with his daughter.
