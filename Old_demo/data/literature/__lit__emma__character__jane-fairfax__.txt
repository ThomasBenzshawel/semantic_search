Jane’s beauty and accomplishment immediately make her
				stand out, but we are likely to follow Emma’s lead at first and
				judge Jane uninteresting on account of her reserve. As Jane gradually
				betrays more personality and emotion, she indicates that she harbors
				some secret sorrow. Eventually, she and Emma push the cloudy confusion behind
				and become friends. The contrast between Jane’s delicate sense of
				propriety and morality and the passionate nature of her feelings
				is much more dramatic than any of the conflicts that Emma experiences.
				Jane’s situation too is much more dire than Emma’s: if Jane does
				not wed, she must become a governess, because she lacks any money
				of her own. The revelation of Jane’s secret engagement to Frank
				makes Jane seem more human, just as Knightley’s humanity is brought
				out by his love for Emma.
