Rearden is the embodiment of productivity, just as Galt
				represents the mind. His legendary capacity for hard work and his
				integrity and skill have made him the most successful industrialist
				in the country. At first, Rearden struggles with important misconceptions about
				himself that undermine his ability to see his own greatness. He
				undergoes a profound transformation in the course of the novel. Despite
				operating his business based on a rational moral code that demands
				value for value, he allows his family to sponge off of him and make
				him feel guilty for his success. This makes him willing to sacrifice
				himself for their flawed morality and saps his vitality. He also
				mistakenly believes in a separation of the mind and body, which makes
				him see physical desire as base and low, and the things of the mind
				as unrelated to the physical world. Dagny and Francisco help him
				to reject this idea, which enables him to embrace his own value.
