Ellen is a quiet and composed girl. She is the same age as Annemarie, though far more solemn. She is a strong student, but aspires to be an actress. Her desire to act becomes symbolic for the terrible way the war forces people to play specific roles. Ellen is Jewish. To save herself, Ellen pretends to be Annemarie's sister so that the Germans do not take her away. For Ellen, the threats of the war are so imminent that she cannot reflect on the war like Annemarie can. Ellen is afraid. Annemarie's connection to Ellen makes the war a more pressing issue in her own life.
