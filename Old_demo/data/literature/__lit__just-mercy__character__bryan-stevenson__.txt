As Just Mercy begins, Bryan Stevenson is a young law student with little courtroom experience and a staunch determination to make a difference. An outsider to the justice system, Stevenson never met a lawyer until he went to law school. When, as a law student, he first visited Walter McMillian, Stevenson had never been to a maximum-security prison or death row. Growing up poor in a racially segregated area of Delaware that still flew Confederate flags, Stevenson’s early experiences fueled his desire to work on behalf of those whose lives are impacted by circumstances out of their control. As a child, Stevenson wondered why his parents worked so hard but never seemed to prosper. This observation taught him that invisible systems keep downtrodden people down. Stevenson’s grandmother taught him that true understanding requires closeness. Stevenson uses his background and his belief in the power of closeness to connect and empathize with his clients like no one else could, seeing them as people, not just prisoners. Both eager to help and intimidated by the sheer number of people who need his assistance, Stevenson continues to broaden his reach even when problems seem unsurmountable. From his internship with the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee, through his founding of the Equal Justice Initiative, and finally his work with children who have no chance of parole, Stevenson continues to attract more disadvantaged people who need help navigating a legal system that refuses to acknowledge their circumstances. Stevenson’s desire to establish a fair playing field for prisoners impacted by poverty, racism, mental illness, and disability drives him to overcome insufficient funding, staff shortages, and corrupt officials who violate people’s rights without fear of recourse. When he feels most defeated, such as during the execution of Jimmy Dill, Stevenson remembers that his despair is evidence of his humanity, a realization that drives him to continue to help people.
