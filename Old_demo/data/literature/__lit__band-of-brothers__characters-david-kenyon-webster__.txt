As a private and as a corporal, David Webster doesn’t volunteer for a single assignment. That isn’t to say he doesn’t do his duty—quite the contrary. Webster is as reliable as any other soldier in his regiment and will gladly sacrifice his life for that of any of his compatriots. Instead of feeling his duty is to fight, however, Webster considers himself to be a spectator of the wartime experience of the soldier, and he believes he must record the experience for the benefit of others. In addition to the letters he sends home, he also writes a book about being a soldier in World War II. Thanks in large part to his detailed accounts and descriptions of his experiences as part of the United States Army, readers have a more accurate recounting of the experiences of Easy Company during history’s greatest war. Webster’s perspective evolves over the year into a dislike of the Army and a hatred for its bureaucracy.
