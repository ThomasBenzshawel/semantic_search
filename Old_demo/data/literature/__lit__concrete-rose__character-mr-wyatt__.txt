Mr. Wyatt is a man with good morals, a solid work ethic, and strong ideas about how Mav should lead his life. He is also wise enough to realize that he can’t simply tell Mav what to do because words can take a while to sink in. He knows that Mav needs to learn the important lessons for himself, so he allows Mav to work and holds Mav accountable for his actions and his performance.

Because Mr. Wyatt is not Mav’s parent and has no ties to the gang world, Mav can speak to Mr. Wyatt about his feelings without worrying that he is being a bad son or a disloyal King Lord. Unlike Faye, Mr. Wyatt does not make decisions for Mav. He does, however, give him the emotional support and the practical advice he needs to complete his education and pave the way to becoming an entrepreneur so that he does not have to look to crime to support himself and his children.
