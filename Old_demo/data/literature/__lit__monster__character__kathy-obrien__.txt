Kathy O’Brien, Steve Harmon’s lawyer, gives her best effort to getting Steve declared not guilty, even though she has doubts about his innocence. That is what a defense attorney does, and O’Brien clearly understands and plays her role. O’Brien is straightforward with Steve. She does not offer him false hope of winning. Sometimes O’Brien asks how Steve is feeling, but she does not express sympathy or offer emotional support. When O’Brien advises Steve to breathe deep, hold his head up, and look calm, she does so only because of the impression he must make on the jury. O’Brien is not personally interested in Steve or his well-being. She tells Steve that her job is to make him look like a human being, but she seems to not think of Steve as anything but a case.

O’Brien’s attitude is revealed in her interactions with Steve. For example, in his meetings with O’Brien, Steve tries to make personal connections by asking O’Brien questions about her life. However, O’Brien does not ask Steve similar questions. She warns him that the prosecutor might see his notes, but she apparently does not read them herself. She shows little interest in Steve’s screenplay.

O’Brien assumes a certain amount of racism among the jurors as well as prejudice in favor of the prosecution. These assumptions show that she is somewhat cynical but also practical and realistic. While O’Brien works hard to ensure Steve is not found guilty, readers note her lack of relief or joy when the trial ends with a not guilty verdict. For example, when the trial is over and Steve tries to hug O’Brien, she stiffly turns away. To the end, O’Brien is professional and detached.
