The alter-ego of the Green Knight, Bertilak of Hautdesert plays host to Sir Gawain from Christmas to New Years. As the other ruler portrayed in the poem, Bertilak can be read against King Arthur. In contrast to Arthur’s restless boyishness, the narrator describes Bertilak as stalwart, suggesting a grounded quality that Arthur has not yet achieved. Both King Arthur’s Camelot and Bertilak’s court have loyal courtiers and knights, abundant food, and entertainment. However, Bertilak’s court, while hospitable, puts less emphasis on chivalric ideals and more on bodily concerns. For example, while King Arthur demands a wonder be told before a feast, feasting at Bertilak’s court has no such delays. In addition, while Sir Gawain initially comes to Bertilak’s castle desiring a place to celebrate Christmas properly, no worship occurs until Gawain has been taken to a room and given warm, clean clothes. Several other factors tie Bertilak and his court to bodily matters, as opposed to spiritual. The brown and drab colors of his court suggest the earth or the ground. The narrator specifically mentions Bertilak’s skill in managing game, that is, making sure that his lands have plentiful food. Finally, the kisses he takes from Gawain evoke lust.
