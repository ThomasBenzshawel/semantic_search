Tristram Shandy, or The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, is a novel by Laurence Sterne, published in nine volumes from 1759 to 1767. It presents itself as the autobiography of Tristram Shandy, who attempts to recount his life but is perpetually sidetracked by digressions, humor, and eccentricities. The novel is a satire of the autobiography genre and a commentary on the nature of fiction and the act of writing. It is considered a precursor to modernist and postmodern literature.Â
