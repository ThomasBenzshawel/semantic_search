Maus: A Survivor’s Tale, by Art Spiegelman, was originally published in serial form in the comics magazine RAW. It was then published in two volumes, with Book I: My Father Bleeds History appearing in 1986 and Book II: And Here My Troubles Began (From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond) appearing in 1992. The book is often credited as one of the very first graphic novels, proving comics could tell formally and emotionally sophisticated stories. Maus tells two stories: how Art Spiegelman’s father Vladek survived World War II and the Holocaust, and how Artie Spiegelman turned that story into the graphic novel Maus.
