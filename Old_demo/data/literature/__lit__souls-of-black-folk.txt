The Souls of Black Folk, by W.E.B. Du Bois, is a collection of non-fiction essays published in 1903 that played a key role in establishing the intellectual foundation for the Black freedom struggle in the 20th century. Some of the essays has previously appeared in the Atlantic Monthly magazine. In the collection, Du Bois reflects on the history of racism in post-slavery America, describes some his own experiences, and proposes potential solutionsâ€”including the pursuit of higher education for Blacks. In addition to its significance in the history of the Civil Rights Movement, The Souls of Black Folk is also considered a foundational work in the field of sociology.
