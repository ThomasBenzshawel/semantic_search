The wealthy and accomplished Francisco is a profoundly
				intelligent and highly successful man whose whole life is a paradox.
				He was the first man to join Galt’s strike and serves as its recruiter,
				living in two worlds as he tries to bring others over to the strikers’
				side. Although he is a brilliant businessman, he deliberately destroys
				d’Anconia Copper and brings down the fortunes of many others with
				it. And although he has only ever loved Dagny, he plays the part
				of a promiscuous playboy as a cover for his real activities. He
				is enthusiastic and benevolent, although much of his strike-related
				activities cause others, especially Dagny and Rearden, to feel he
				is mocking and untrustworthy. Francisco has a profound effect on
				Rearden, whom he genuinely loves, even while knowing Rearden is
				Dagny’s lover. He serves as Rearden’s protector, arming him with
				the moral certainty he needs to battle the looters. He seems to
				appear at Rearden’s side when he is needed most, and saves his life
				in the mill riots. 

Francisco’s commitment to the strike is absolute, but
				he suffers a great deal for it. First, he must give up Dagny and
				allow her to view him as depraved and worthless. Later, he must
				endure Rearden’s hatred as well, when he is forced to betray him
				in a copper deal. And he must continually work to destroy the company
				his family built for generations. But the suffering is worth the
				price for him, because he is sure that he is right. Eventually,
				Dagny and Rearden come to understand and admire him, and the strike
				he devotes his life to works as planned.
