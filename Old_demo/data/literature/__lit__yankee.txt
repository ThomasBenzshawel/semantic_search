A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a satirical novel by Mark Twain, first published in 1889. It is the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident of Hartford, Connecticut, who is inexplicably transported back in time to the court of King Arthur. Hank uses his knowledge of modern technology to try to improve the lives of the people he encounters, but his efforts are ultimately unsuccessful. Twain’s novel is a critique of romanticized views of the past and a commentary on the dangers of unchecked technological progress.
