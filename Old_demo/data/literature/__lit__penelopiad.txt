In the 2005 novella The Penelopiad: The Myth of Penelope and Odysseus, Canadian author Margaret Atwood retells the well-known story of the Odyssey from a different point of view: the wife of Odysseus, Penelope, and the twelve Maids he murdered upon his return home to Ithaca. Penelope uses the narrative to rewrite her legacy, while the Maids act as a Greek chorus, providing their own story and at times contradicting her. The Penelopiad is part of the Canongate Myth Series, a group of novellas in which contemporary authors retell ancient myths.
