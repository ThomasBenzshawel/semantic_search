Pippin, together with his companion Merry, represents
				the entire Hobbit race in the first half of The Two Towers, as
				Frodo and Sam do not appear in this portion of the story at all.
				Pippin is typically Hobbitlike in his kindness, humility, and ordinary
				mixture of flaws and fears. He is more clever and quick-thinking
				than he is bold or courageous—as when he engineers his escape from
				the Orcs not by attacking them, but by profiting from a knife that
				falls near his hand bindings. Still, even if Pippin is not a typical
				adventure hero, he shows a firmness of purpose and a quick-wittedness
				that make him a valuable member of the Fellowship.

The honorable Pippin is a highly likable character. He
				is thoughtful and generous, as when he loans his beloved tobacco
				pipe to Gimli, who yearns for a good smoke. Pippin likes to relax,
				as we see when Gandalf comes upon him and Merry smoking and chatting
				at Saruman’s headquarters. Pippin values companionship highly; one of
				his few moments of relief during his Orc captivity is when he happens
				to be thrown on the ground near Merry, with whom he is able to enjoy
				a brief conversation before being silenced. Pippin and his friend
				Merry are a refreshing presence in The Two Towers, largely because
				they are not superhuman or larger than life, as
				so many of the others are. Instead, these two hobbits are simple
				creatures with simple pleasures and failings. Their ordinary natures
				help us to identify with their mission, as we can picture ourselves
				in their places.
