Magua, an Indian of the Huron tribe, plays the crafty
				villain to Hawkeye’s rugged hero. Because of his exile by Colonel
				Munro, Magua seeks revenge. He does not want to do bodily harm to Munro
				but wants to bruise the colonel’s psyche. Magua has a keen understanding
				of whites’ prejudices, and he knows that threatening to marry the
				colonel’s daughter will terrify Colonel Monroe. Magua’s threat to
				marry a white woman plays on white men’s fears of interracial marriage.
				When Magua kidnaps Cora, the threat of physical violence or rape
				hangs in the air, although no one ever speaks of it. Whereas the
				interracial attraction between Uncas and Cora strikes us as sweet
				and promising for happier race relations in the future, the violent
				unwanted advances of Magua to Cora show an exaggerated fulfillment
				of white men’s fears. However, while anger originally motivates
				Magua, affection eventually characterizes his feelings for Cora.
				He refuses to harm her, even when in one instance his actions put
				himself in danger. Magua’s psychology becomes slightly more complicated
				by the end of the novel, when sympathy tempers his evil.
