Published in 2013, Dave Egger’s dystopian novel The Circle traces a young woman’s rise through an innovative tech company—called "the Circle"—whose power begins to threaten the foundations of democratic institutions. Against the backdrop of a coming-of-age story about the young woman's journey from college to the working world, the novel was an international bestseller that examines issues including surveillance, privacy, and how technology can interfere with our lives. Eggers, who grew up in the Chicago suburbs, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for The Circle.
