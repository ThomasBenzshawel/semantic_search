The Autobiography of Malcolm X is an autobiography by Malcolm X and Alex Haley that was published in 1965—the same year as Malcolm X’s assassination. It is the result of a collaboration between Malcolm X and journalist and writer Alex Haley. Over a period of several years, Malcolm X told Haley his life story in a series of lengthy interviews. Haley wrote down and arranged the material in the first person, and Malcolm X edited and approved every chapter. The work is considered one of the most important nonfiction books of all time.
