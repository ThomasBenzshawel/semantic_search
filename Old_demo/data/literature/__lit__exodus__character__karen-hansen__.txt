Karen Hansen Clement’s capacity for love and her ability to keep hope alive allows her to thrive amidst chaos and to heal those around her. Her capacity for love is evident early on as she quickly adapts to life with the Hansens. Her ability to forgive means she never blames her father for the indecisiveness that led to the destruction of their family. Instead, she tries to find him, and her journey to do so provides a way forward for her. Karen’s love has the power to transform others, and her influence redeems both Kitty and Dov alike. She never gives up hope for the emotionally broken Dov, and this act of faith leads to Dov’s healing and redemption. Dov learns from Karen that hatred and revenge are a dead end, and that his life is in front of him, rather than behind. By the light of Karen’s example, Kitty comes to understand what a life of service means and how important it is. She sees the way Karen’s devotion to Israel never wavers and this inspires Kitty to devote herself as well. Karen’s conviction that Israel’s cause is just leads her to the dangerous settlement in Gaza. Yet, Karen’s love and empathy even extends to the people who ultimately kill her. It is Karen’s unwavering hope, empathy, and love that provides an example for Dov. It allows him to process his grief over her death and to avoid backsliding into hatred and revenge-seeking. Karen Hansen Clement is the story’s redeemer.
