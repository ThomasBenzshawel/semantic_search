Violet contrasts sharply to Titus and his friends and departs from social norms in many ways. Importantly, she only receives her feed when she is seven, given that her parents initially couldn’t afford one, and had reservations about how it would affect her. In fact, her mother, who abandoned the family when Violet was young, opted never to have one installed. Since an early age, Violet has also been home-schooled by her highly educated, and highly informed, professor father. Her feed-free youth, socio-economic status, and home-life all help her see the world with a clearer perspective than Titus and his friends: Violet lives with her eyes wide open, refuses to ignore the suffering and destruction corporations have caused, and tries to make Titus and his friends see the reality of their situation. 

Violet is also wise to the dangers of data mining and blind consumerism, telling Titus that corporations trick people into wanting things and are reducing people into simplified personality types. To defy them, and to preserve her individuality, Violet determines to resist by creating a completely confusing customer profile and asks Titus to join her resistance. Ironically, Violet’s desire to visit the moon finally experience normal life, and her ensuing act of resistance, help lead to her demise. But her wisdom, bravery, and actions, optimists can hope, likely awakened Titus.
