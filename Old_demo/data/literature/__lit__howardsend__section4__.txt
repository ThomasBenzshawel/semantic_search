					The next day, Leonard comes to visit the
					Schlegels to apologize for his wife's intrusion.
					Trying to speak loftily, he first refuses to explain
					why Jacky thought he was at Wickham Place.
					Eventually, he drops his awkward affectations and
					starts talking about how, in an attempt to get back
					to nature, he walked all night and much of the next
					day.  Intrigued, the Schlegels think that he has
					made a heroic attempt to break through the dullness
					of his daily life and to connect with something
					spiritually real.  That night, Margaret and
					Helen go to a dinner party discussion group, at
					which they debate the question of allocating money
					to the poor; they talk so much about Leonard that
					everyone at the party begins using his name as a
					kind of shorthand for the poor in general.
					Afterward, they meet Mr. Wilcox, who has doubled
					his fortune since Mrs. Wilcox's death.  He tells
					them that he and Evie have rented Howards End to
					an invalid and moved to a much larger home.  When
					they tell him about Leonard, he warns them that the
					Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company, where Leonard is
					a clerk, is an unsound operation that will crash
					before Christmas.  The Schlegels agree to advise
					Leonard to find a new job.
				


					They invite Leonard to tea, but the encounter is a
					disaster; associating the Schlegels with an abstract
					idea of wealth and romance, he blanches at
					discussing business with them, and they have no
					interest in listening to his ramblings about his
					reading when there is such an important
					consideration at stake.  After Mr. Wilcox and Evie
					arrive unexpectedly, Leonard loses his temper and
					accuses Margaret and Helen of trying to pry into his
					knowledge of the insurance company to make money for
					themselves.  He storms away, and the Schlegel
					sisters are left to play with the Wilcoxes' puppies.
				


					As lapsing of the lease on the Schlegels' Wickham Place
					residence draws near, Margaret begins frantically
					searching for a new house.  She hopes to find one
					before the siblings depart for their annual visit to
					Aunt Juley, but has no success.  She dines with
					Mr. Wilcox, Evie, and Evie's fiance, Percy Cahill,
					and realizes that she and Mr. Wilcox are beginning to
					be real friends.  She and Tibby take him to a
					faddish restaurant where all the people discuss
					spiritual auras and astral planes, a display which he
					tolerates with good humor.  Eventually, it is time to
					visit Aunt Juley at Swanage, and the Schlegels have
					still not found a new house.
				


					The lives of the three main groups of
					characters--the Schlegels, the Wilcoxes, and
					Leonard--begin to intertwine in this section, with Leonard's
					second visit to Wickham Place and Mr. Wilcox's
					advice for the clerk to leave his job at the
					Porphyrion Insurance Company.  Additionally, Mr.
					Wilcox and Margaret are beginning to form a
					surprising friendship.  In the disastrous
					encounter at Wickham Place, when all three groups
					share a space for the first time and Leonard loses
					his temper, the belittling effect Forster ascribes
					to poverty is in full view.
				


					Leonard has no reason to suspect the Schlegels, and
					certainly no reason to think that his very limited
					knowledge of the insurance business could bring them
					financial profit.  But hard experience has taught
					him to be suspicious of other people, and when his
					carefully crafted idea of romance is disappointed by
					the actual environment at the tea, his petty
					suspicion is fueled by complex inner feelings.  When
					he begins screaming at Margaret, he is really angry
					that his visit has not lived up to his romantic
					hopes of discussing books, beauty, and poetry, but
					unable to express those feelings, he accuses them of
					using him for profit instead.
				


					As the impending loss of Wickham Place begins to
					loom over the Schlegels' lives, the symbolic
					importance of houses in this novel becomes a main
					thematic concern.  Roughly interpreted, houses tend
					to express the ideals and positions of their
					occupants, so that Wickham Place is a haven of art
					and culture, while the Wilcoxes' flat (and flats in
					general, as the widespread construction of high-rise
					apartment buildings was a new development in London
					at the time the novel was written) represents the
					same middle-class detachment and materialism that
					the Wilcoxes themselves often represent.  Howards
					End, on the other hand, is a more complicated
					symbol; it is the title of the novel, and is
					generally understood as a symbol for all of England.
				


					Forster's guiding idea for Howards End was a
					question (as critic Lionel Trilling has expressed):
					"Who shall inherit England?"  At a time of enormous
					social and economic change, Forster
					explored the forces affecting each social
					class in an effort to determine which set of values
					and circumstances would prevail in England as a
					whole.  Remember also that one of the main concerns
					of the novel, introduced with Mrs. Wilcox's
					dying wish to leave her home to Margaret, and
					continued throughout in references made by Mr. Wilcox to
					his will, is "Who shall inherit Howards End?"
