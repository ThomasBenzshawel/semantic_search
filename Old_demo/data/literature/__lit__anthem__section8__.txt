Several days later, Equality 7-2521 begins
					writing in his journal for the first time since he entered the Uncharted
					Forest. As he is walking through the forest, Equality 7-2521 hears
					footsteps behind him and discovers that the Golden One has followed
					him into the forest. He asks her how she came to be in the forest,
					and she answers, swaying with her fists at her side, only that she
					has found him. He asks her again, and she tells him that she has
					followed him because she heard talk all over the city of his encounter
					with the World Council of Scholars and his fleeing into the Uncharted
					Forest.

The Golden One is tattered from the journey through the
					forest, but she is not weary or afraid. She tells Equality 7-2521 she
					wants to share in his damnation and to follow him wherever he goes.
					Her voice is bitter and triumphant as she tells him that he is harder, prouder,
					and more beautiful than her brothers. She begs him to do what he
					will with her but not to send her away, and she bows in front of
					him. He raises her to her feet and kisses her, amazed by the very
					idea of kissing. They stand together for a long time.

Equality 7-2521 tells the Golden
					One that there is nothing to fear in the forest or in their solitude,
					and he suggests that they forget their brothers and remember only
					that they are together and have joy between them. He declares the
					world their own, and they walk through the forest hand in hand.
					That night they have sex, and Equality 7-2521 realizes
					that sex is the only ecstasy in a man’s life.

Equality 7-2521 and the Golden
					One walk for several days together and make bows and arrows to kill
					birds. At night, they sleep in a ring of campfires, to keep out
					the beasts. They plan to stop and build a house some day, and they
					see their days together as endless. When Equality 7-2521 begins
					to be puzzled by his new life, he hurries ahead and forgets his
					troubles as he watches the Golden One following him. She is completely
					obedient to him and does not question him about anything.

For the first time in his life, Equality 7-2521 begins
					to doubt the laws he was taught by the society in which he lived.
					He questions how it can be that everything that is solitude is evil
					when he and the Golden One are pursuing solitude in such happiness.
					He observes that the only things that have ever given him joy in
					his life are the lightbulb and the Golden One, neither of which
					has anything to do with his brothers. He concludes that both these
					joys come from himself alone. He also begins to suspect that there
					is some error in the way he has been thinking up to this point,
					that there is some word that is missing from his vocabulary, but
					he does not know what it is.

The Golden One tries to tell Equality 7-2521 that
					she loves him, but she does not know how to say the word “I.” She
					tells him that “[w]e love you,” but she is not satisfied with this
					articulation of her feelings, and she gropes for something more
					personal but does not know how to express it. The moment leaves
					both of them feeling confused.

Feminists are troubled by Rand’s view of women, especially
					by the Golden One’s subservience to Equality 7-2521 and
					her inherent inability to create solutions to her intellectual puzzles
					without the help of Equality 7-2521. They
					note that the Golden One is never appreciated for her own worth
					but instead is worshipped as an object, that even her name is somewhat
					insulting in that it characterizes her by the color of her hair,
					and that she has virtually no part in the story except as the thing
					that Equality 7-2521 adores. Rand might answer
					that when the Golden One bows in front of Equality 7-2521,
					she is merely acknowledging the perfection in him and offering him
					herself as equally perfect. After all, she would say, Equality 7-2521 is
					drawn to her as much as she is drawn to him, and her fleeing society
					to chase him into the forest represents as great a break with society
					as his confrontation with the World Council of Scholars. Moreover,
					Rand might say, the Golden One suspects at the same time that Equality 7-2521 does
					that the lack of the word “I” is a major problem. Nevertheless,
					feminists are not satisfied with the continuous emphasis on the
					Golden One’s dependence on Equality 7-2521 and
					her constantly following him while he offers her no reciprocal form
					of trust. They argue that Equality 7-2521’s
					observation that the lightbulb and the Golden One both spring from
					himself belittles the Golden One, who is, after all, not the actual
					invention of Equality 7-2521. Rand might
					respond that she is merely mimicking the biblical story of Adam
					and Eve, in which Eve springs from Adam’s rib and is, in a certain
					sense, an extension of her husband.

Rand presents several ways of testing the world around
					us in Anthem, and ultimately she concludes that
					the best way to make determinations about the world is to test them
					against our own inner reactions. As Equality 7-2521 begins
					to doubt his society for the first time, he engages in a kind of
					thought process previously foreign to him in that he begins to compare
					what he is discovering of the world to what he has been taught of
					it. Notably, the way that Equality 7-2521 uncovers
					truths about the world is very different from the way he proceeds
					earlier with his scientific experiments. In his experiments, he
					proceeds like a good scientist, tinkering and tooling until his
					lightbulb works, and testing and retesting, while isolating factors,
					to discover electricity. When investigating facts about the world,
					however, Equality 7-2521 proceeds largely
					by instinct, so that he is called by his heart to discover that
					there is some word missing from his vocabulary, but he does not
					have an experiment to perform to determine what it is. Likewise,
					when he is trying to discover what makes him happy, he proceeds
					chiefly through induction, observing which things make him happy
					and determining where those things come from, in order to determine
					how happiness comes to be. To determine what is true about human
					nature, he must act as his own instrument.


Anthem’s extensive foreshadowing gives
					away many of the secrets of the story before Rand reveals them.
					The Golden One’s attempt to say “I love you,” for example, is one
					of several events that foreshadow the massive revelation, at the
					end of Anthem, that the individual is the center
					of the universe. The Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word’s death
					in Chapter II, before which he specifically seeks out Equality 7-2521 as
					he burns in the town square, also presages the coming realization
					that what Equality 7-2521 has been missing
					is the word “I.” Most obvious, the language of the entire novella,
					which uses the first person plural “we” to refer to the individual
					is a major clue that the resolution of the story’s conflict involves
					a shift in the language. Indeed, taken as a whole, these clues leave
					very little suspense in Anthem. It is fairly clear
					from the outset and at every step of the way that Rand is leading
					us to an ego-centered world. The lack of suspense, however, which
					reinforces the idea that Anthem is more political
					manifesto than fiction, allows Rand to drive her point home time
					and again without making us wonder where she is headed.
