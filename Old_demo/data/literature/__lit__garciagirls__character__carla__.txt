As the oldest daughter, Carla felt most out of place in
				the United States and had the most trouble fitting in to her new
				social and cultural environment. She was harassed at school by malicious
				and prejudiced boys, and felt isolated by her limited English language abilities.
				Her discomfort with puberty was exacerbated by an encounter with
				a perverted American exhibitionist in a car. She dealt with these
				issues later in life by becoming a psychologist and analyzing her
				family's myriad mental problems.
