Clarissa Dalloway, the heroine of the novel, struggles
				constantly to balance her internal life with the external world.
				Her world consists of glittering surfaces, such as fine fashion,
				parties, and high society, but as she moves through that world she
				probes beneath those surfaces in search of deeper meaning. Yearning
				for privacy, Clarissa has a tendency toward introspection that gives
				her a profound capacity for emotion, which many other characters
				lack. However, she is always concerned with appearances and keeps
				herself tightly composed, seldom sharing her feelings with anyone.
				She uses a constant stream of convivial chatter and activity to
				keep her soul locked safely away, which can make her seem shallow
				even to those who know her well. 

	Constantly overlaying the past and the present, Clarissa
				strives to reconcile herself to life despite her potent memories.
				For most of the novel she considers aging and death with trepidation,
				even as she performs life-affirming actions, such as buying flowers.
				Though content, Clarissa never lets go of the doubt she feels about
				the decisions that have shaped her life, particularly her decision
				to marry Richard instead of Peter Walsh. She understands that life
				with Peter would have been difficult, but at the same time she is
				uneasily aware that she sacrificed passion for the security and
				tranquility of an upper-class life. At times she wishes for a chance
				to live life over again. She experiences a moment of clarity and
				peace when she watches her old neighbor through her window, and
				by the end of the day she has come to terms with the possibility
				of death. Like Septimus, Clarissa feels keenly the oppressive forces
				in life, and she accepts that the life she has is all sheâ€™ll get.
				Her will to endure, however, prevails.
