Frank epitomizes attractiveness in speech, manner, and
				appearance. He goes out of his way to please everyone, and, while
				the more perceptive characters question his seriousness, everyone
				except Knightley is charmed enough to be willing to indulge him.
				Frank is the character who most resembles Emma, a connection she
				points out at the novel’s close when she states that “destiny …
				connect[s] us with two characters so much superior to our own.”
				Like Emma, Frank develops over the course of the novel by trading
				a somewhat vain and superficial perspective on the world for the
				seriousness brought on by the experience of genuine suffering and
				love. He is a complex character because though we know we should
				judge him harshly in moral terms, we cannot help but like him more
				than he deserves to be liked.
