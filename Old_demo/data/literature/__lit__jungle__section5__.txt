[T]here were things that went into the
						sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.

Jurgis and his family know all of the dirty secrets
					of the meat-packing industry. The most spoiled of meats becomes
					sausage. All manner of dishonesty exists in the industry’s willingness
					to sell diseased, rotten, and adulterated meat to American households.
					The working members of the family fall into a silent stupor due
					to the grinding poverty and misery of their lives. Ona and Jurgis
					grow apart, and Jurgis begins to drink heavily. He delivers himself
					from full-blown alcoholism through force of will, but the desire
					to drink always torments him.

Antanas suffers various childhood illnesses, and the measles attack
					him with fury. His strong constitution allows him to reach his first
					birthday, but he is as malnourished as the rest of the Packingtown
					poor. Ona, pregnant again, develops a bad cough and suffers increasingly
					frequent bouts of hysterical crying.

Winter arrives again, and with it comes the grueling rush
					season. Fifteen- and sixteen-hour workdays are frequent. Twice,
					Ona does not return home at night. She explains that the snow drifts
					kept her away so she stayed with a friend. When Jurgis discovers
					that she is lying, he wrangles a confession out of her. Sobbing
					hysterically, Ona confesses that Phil Connor, a boss at her factory,
					continually harassed her and pleaded with her to become his mistress.
					She tells Jurgis that Connor eventually raped her in the factory
					after everyone had gone home and threatened to arrange the firings
					of every wage earner in her household. Moreover, he threatened to
					prevent them from obtaining work in Packingtown ever again. With
					these threats, he forced her into accompanying him to Miss Henderson’s brothel
					in the evenings for the past two months.

Jurgis, livid, storms to Ona’s workplace. Upon seeing
					the coarse-looking and liquor-reeking Connor, he leaps at him and
					sinks his fingers into Connor’s throat. He channels all of his outrage
					about the rape into such a thrashing frenzy that he doesn’t even
					notice the pandemonium in the factory. A half-dozen men finally
					tear Jurgis, blood and skin dripping from his teeth, from the unconscious
					Connor and take him to the police station.

[C]ould they find no better way to punish
						him than to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve
						and freeze?

Jurgis is arrested and taken to jail, where old men and
					boys, hardened criminals and petty criminals, innocent men and guilty
					men share the same squalid quarters. A date is designated for Jurgis’s trial
					and his bond is set at three hundred dollars. Afterward, he is taken
					to the county jail and made to strip; he is then walked, naked, down
					a hallway past the inmates, who leer and make comments. He is put
					into a small cell with a filthy, bug-infested mattress. Upon hearing
					a clanging of bells that evening, Jurgis realizes that it is Christmas
					Eve. He recalls the previous Christmas, when he and Ona walked along
					the avenue with the children and gazed at the marvelous food and
					toys in the store windows. He begins to sob when he thinks of his
					family spending Christmas without him and with Ona ill. He laments
					his family’s plight and feels that the Christmas chimes are mocking
					him.

While Jurgis awaits his trial, he becomes friends with
					his cellmate, Jack Duane. Jack claims to be an educated man from
					the east. He says that his father committed suicide after failing
					in business. He adds that a big company later cheated him out of
					a lucrative invention. His misfortunes led Jack to become a safe
					breaker. Before Jurgis’s trial, Jack gives Jurgis his mistress’s
					address and encourages him to seek his help should the need arise.

Jurgis’s trial is a farce. Kotrina and Teta Elzbieta attend
					it. Phil Connor testifies that he fired Ona fairly and that Jurgis
					attacked him for revenge. Jurgis tells his side of the story through
					an interpreter, but the judge is not sympathetic. He sentences Jurgis
					to thirty days in prison. Jurgis begs for clemency on the ground
					that his family will starve if he cannot work, but the judge remains
					firm.

In Bridewell Prison, Jurgis and the other prisoners
					spend the greater portion of their time breaking stone. He writes
					a postcard to his family to let them know where he is. Ten days
					later, Stanislovas visits to tell him that he, Ona, Marija, and
					Teta Elzbieta have all lost their jobs and that they are unable
					to pay rent or buy food. Marija is suffering blood poisoning because
					she cut her hand at work. Ona lies in bed, crying all day. Teta
					Elzbieta’s sausage factory shut down. Stanislovas lost his job after
					a snowstorm prevented him from going to work for three days. They
					cannot obtain other jobs because they are too sick and weak and because
					Connor is scheming to prevent them from finding work. Stanislovas
					asks if Jurgis can help them. Jurgis has no more than fourteen cents
					to give. Kotrina, Stanislovas, and the children earn money selling
					papers. Their only other income comes from begging.

Packingtown is full of predators and, as they have done
					throughout The Jungle, these hostile forces continue
					to attack the family bond that unites the immigrants. Phil Connor,
					empowered by his criminal connections, violates the sacred
					marriage bond between Jurgis and Ona, one of the few things of meaning
					that the two still possess. The idea of powerlessness pervades this
					grim section; no poor person has the power to fight for him- or
					herself. Marija tries to fight for her full wages, only to be fired;
					Ona cannot afford to reject Connor’s advances because he has the
					power to ruin her family. The wage laborer is systematically crippled
					and silenced by the power structure of capitalism.

In his attack on Connor, in Chapter 15, Jurgis
					exhibits an animalistic fury. Sinclair compares him to a “wounded
					bull” and a “tiger,” and the image of Jurgis hovering over Connor
					with his mouth full of Connor’s blood and skin evokes the primal,
					bestial quality of his rage. Ironically, the factories seek this
					sort of unrefined animal energy in their workers, which they can
					channel into efficient labor. Everywhere in Packingtown, there are
					wage laborers who suffer from some form of permanent disfigurement
					directly or indirectly related to their work. In a sense, the prevalence
					of these disfiguring injuries is a metaphor for the butchery of
					human bodies—which, like animals, are slaughtered in the service
					of profit.

With Jurgis’s sentencing, Sinclair argues that
					capitalism has perverted the American justice system. Judges are
					bought and sold by men with power and money, giving impunity to
					men like Connor. Furthermore, in Jurgis’s case,
					the judge does not care that his ruling means the difference between
					starvation and survival for an entire family.

Sinclair also charges capitalism with being anti-Christian.
					Immigrants (both Christian and Jewish) from eastern-European countries held
					fast to their religious beliefs and traditions upon coming to America
					as a source of strength and a sense of heritage. Here, however,
					Jurgis is forced to spend the Christmas holidays separated from his
					family, and his inability to work leads to them being evicted from their
					home at a time of year that is traditionally festive. Jurgis’s recollection
					of practically drooling over food and toys in store windows on the
					previous Christmas pits the harsh and cruel reality of capitalism
					at odds with the immigrants’ fantasies. Jurgis cannot afford the
					store window contents; his inability to be a consumer marks his
					failure as a producer, according to the capitalist system.

The family’s slew of misfortunes following Jurgis’s imprisonment clearly
					marks the beginning of the family’s inevitable descent into ruin.
					Sinclair foreshadows this fall throughout the early sections of the
					novel; his commitment to exemplifying the evils of capitalism necessitates
					that these exploited immigrants fail in their naïve pursuit of the
					American Dream. Throughout the novel, Sinclair relentlessly insists
					that hard work, family values, self-reliance, and self-motivated
					action—the underpinnings of the American Dream—do absolutely nothing
					to provide the means for social advancement. The wage laborers that
					populate The Jungle are moved inevitably toward
					ruin and abuse by forces beyond their control. Capitalism becomes
					a force as inevitable and careless as nature. It picks off unfortunate
					individuals as carelessly as cold weather, disease, and heat exhaustion.
