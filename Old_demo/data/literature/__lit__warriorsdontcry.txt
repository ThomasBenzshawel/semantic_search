Warriors Don’t Cry is a young adult nonfiction memoir by journalist and educator Melba Patillo Beals that was first published in 1994. It describes the author’s experiences as one of the “Little Rock Nine”—a group of Black students who integrated Little Rock Central High School in 1957 in the wake of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education. In Warriors Don’t Cry, Melba describes her year attending Central High School—a year that centers around maturation, race relations, and challenging the power dynamic in the United States.
