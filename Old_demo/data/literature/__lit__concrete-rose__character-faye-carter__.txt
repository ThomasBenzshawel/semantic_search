Faye is Mav’s mother, who has been raising Mav as a single parent since Adonis went to jail. If Faye is bitter about the challenges life throws her way, she does not let her feelings keep her from doing what she needs to do to provide for and protect her family. She is upset with her husband for putting her and Mav in a tight situation, but she does not hesitate to go to him when she feels that Mav needs his father’s guidance. In this way, Faye tries to keep Adonis as a figure in Mav’s life, which many of the boys they know do not have. Faye is upset with her son for getting two girls pregnant, but she is never unkind.

Faye shows her strength and grit when she takes Mav and Iesha aside to discuss their custody arrangement and proves to be a pragmatic woman. She knows that even though Mav is trying his best to care for Seven, Mav cannot clearly see what needs to be done, and Iesha can barely care for herself. Faye makes the tough decisions for them, knowing that it will be the best for them all, including her grandson.
