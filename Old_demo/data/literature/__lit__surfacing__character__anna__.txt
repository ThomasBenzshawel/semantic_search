Anna’s primary role in Surfacing is to crystallize the
				narrator’s opinions about love, sex, and marriage. Anna’s constant chatter helps
				the narrator to better understand relationships. She asks whether the narrator
				takes birth control, mentioning the blood clot she developed in her leg as a
				result of taking the pill. Anna’s frankness about contraception allows the
				narrator to identify contraception as a male invention that puts
				females at risk. When the narrator asks Anna about marriage, Anna’s
				comparison of marriage to skiing blindly down a hill helps
				solidify the narrator’s fear of marriage. Also, Anna’s admission that David
				either withholds sex or hurts her during sex helps the narrator to see the way
				men use sex as a weapon. 

The narrator also observes the psychological cruelty that men inflict on
				women through the way that Anna crumbles in the face of David’s cruel jokes. The
				degradation of Anna’s marriage confirms the narrator’s suspicions about marriage
				in general. At first, the narrator seems to envy Anna’s love for her husband,
				and she marvels at the way Anna keeps her marriage together. However, the
				narrator eventually comes to understand Anna’s marriage as one balanced by hate
				rather than love, and David’s cynicism allows her to reject marriage altogether.
				Anna’s life as a whole becomes a cautionary tale for the narrator. The narrator
				learns through Anna the pitfalls of unhappy marriage, empty sex, and fractured
				love.
