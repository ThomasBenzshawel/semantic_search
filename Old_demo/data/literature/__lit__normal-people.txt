Normal People, Irish writer Sally Rooney’s second novel, is a coming-of-age story about young love that also explores complex issues like mental health, identity, miscommunication, and the changing social and political climate in Ireland. Rooney attended Trinity College in Dublin where she was named a scholar. She began exploring the characters of Connell and Marianne in a short story she published in 2016. Normal People was published in 2018. The book was a best-seller in the United States and spawned a critically acclaimed and Emmy-nominated Hulu original television series. Critics have hailed Rooney as the “foremost millennial novelist.”
