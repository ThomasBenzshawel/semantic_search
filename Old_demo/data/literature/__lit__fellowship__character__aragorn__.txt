Aragorn, much like Gandalf, hides an impressive amount
				of power, greatness, and knowledge under a humble exterior. We first
				meet Aragorn as Strider, the laconic, worn Ranger at the Prancing
				Pony inn in Bree. As the action moves forward, we see Aragorn slowly transform
				into the king he is destined to become. Aragorn also displays Gandalf’s
				bravery, kindness, and wisdom—indeed, neither of them appear to
				have any major faults to speak of. At certain moments, however,
				Aragorn does display a sort of vulnerability. When questioned about
				why he does not immediately offer proof of his identity to the hobbits
				in Bree, one of his answers is simply that he wishes the hobbits
				would count him as a friend without knowledge of his lineage—indeed,
				he is tired of being constantly wary. Such an admission is a poignant
				revelation of a somewhat unexpected trait in such an indomitable
				woodsman and warrior as Aragorn.
