De Guiche is an opposing double to Cyrano. He represents
				everything that Cyrano would become if Cyrano were to use his wit
				for flattery and social climbing. De Guiche is a violent, vengeful,
				and bitter man. As the play’s villain, he constantly plans to have
				Cyrano killed, and he is unafraid to admit it.

	He serves as a symbol of misguided aristocracy and ineffective leadership.
				His troops do not respect him. They approve of him only late in
				the play, when he leads a complex military maneuver for the French
				and then helps rescue Roxane from the dangers of battle. He does
				become a better person near the end of the play—a change stemming
				from Cyrano’s remarkable example of kindness, heroism, and respectability.
