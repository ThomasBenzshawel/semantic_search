Howard Roark is the undisputed hero of The Fountainhead, and
				his story drives the novel. His name contains the words “hard” and “roar,”
				both of which accurately describe his tough, determined character.
				Roark’s buildings suggest his personality, for like Roark they are
				innovative and austere. Roark never compromises or deviates from
				his principles. Rand holds him up as everything that man can and
				should be. Consequently, Roark does not develop over the course
				of the novel—the ideal man does not need to change. Although Rand
				despised religion, she often describes Roark as if he is a religious
				figure. Roark does not preach, and he never actively seeks converts,
				but he inspires absolute devotion and rapture in his followers.
				Cameron, Mallory, Dominique, and Wynand change their entire belief
				systems after meeting him. Dominique in particular exhibits a religious
				passion for Roark, racked by ecstasy and guilt as if inspired by
				a messiah. Like all Christ figures in literature, Roark’s enemies
				persecute him. Despite the hatred of the world, Roark lives life
				as Rand thinks it should be lived.
