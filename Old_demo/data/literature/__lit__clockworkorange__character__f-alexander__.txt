Though they share a name, F. Alexander and Alex are quite
				different from each other. While Alex is an intuitive creature who
				makes decisions based on impulse, F. Alexander is an “intelligent
				type bookman type” who behaves according to abstract concepts, which
				he ponders from the safety of his country home, far away from the
				city streets with which he seems so concerned. F. Alexander thinks
				in broad, theoretical terms, and has trouble focusing on specifics. When
				Alex begs for mercy after being beaten by the police, F. Alexander
				pities him not as a suffering boy, but as an abstract “victim of the
				modern age.” Similarly, when Alex asks him how he expects to improve
				Alex’s life through the exploitation of his victim status, F. Alexander
				can’t provide an answer. F. Alexander claims to want to help people like Alex,
				but he remains unconcerned with Alex as a particular, individual
				person.

F. Alexander’s failure to embrace actual human reality
				can be read as a criticism of liberalist ideologies, which Burgess
				has criticized for being committed to improving the lot of mankind
				at the expense of man himself. F. Alexander’s belief that man is
				“a creature of growth and capable of sweetness” is a noble one,
				especially because he has experienced first-hand the kind of evil
				men are capable of. However, his readiness to use Alex, also a creature
				of growth and capable of sweetness, as a “thing” with which to wage
				war against the State reveals a certain degree of hypocrisy.
