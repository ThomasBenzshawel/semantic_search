Mary becomes the Proctors’ servant after Abigail is let go. She’s a weak person, prone to hysterics and drawn to drama. She moves back and forth between the pack of lying girls and the Proctors, drawn by the girls but knowing the Proctors are innocent. She knows that the girls are lying and that there is no witchcraft in Salem. She realizes that Abigail intends to use the ruse of accusing Elizabeth of being a witch to get Elizabeth executed so Abigail can marry John, and she knows that Elizabeth has never done anything wrong. For much of the third act, Mary tries to help, despite her intense and justified fear of Abigail and the girls. Yet she is not strong enough to stand up for what is right, and eventually gives in to the girls, going so far as accusing John of being a witch, too.
