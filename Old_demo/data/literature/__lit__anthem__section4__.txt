While dissecting a frog hanging on a copper wire, Equality 7-2521 discovers
					the power of electricity, which he explores in his tunnel underground.
					In his journal, he recounts his experiments: he makes a magnet move
					using electricity and creates a lighting rod outside the tunnel.
					He explores his tunnel to look for technology, and he discovers
					unidentified boxes with wires and switches and lightbulbs, although
					he does not yet know how to use them. He worries that he is the
					only person in the world with this knowledge because he has been
					taught that the Council of Scholars knows everything and that all
					men share all collective knowledge. Along these lines of thinking, anything
					known by only one person cannot be true by virtue of the fact that
					not everyone knows it.

At first Equality 7-2521 says that
					he has discovered a new power that was previously unknown to any
					man. This power frightens him even though he believes it is a very
					important and potent force. Later, Equality 7-2521 concludes
					that electricity is the power of the sky, and that men in the Unmentionable
					Times had harnessed the power of the sky. He becomes an avid scientist,
					exploring the power of electricity, and in his quest he realizes
					how much he does not know and how much of his previous learning
					had been mistaken. Equality 7-2521 announces
					in his journal that he knows more than the Council of Scholars,
					something which his society believes is impossible.

Many days after his first conversation with the Golden
					One, Equality 7-2521 speaks to her again
					by the hedges along the road he sweeps. She is waiting for him there
					when he arrives one afternoon, and he sees that she will obey him,
					despite her scorn for the rest of the world. He tells her that he
					has renamed her “the Golden One,” and she tells him that she has
					renamed him “the Unconquered.” He warns her that such thoughts are
					not permitted, and she responds that he thinks them anyway and wants
					her to think them. He agrees, but, calling her “dearest one,” warns
					her not to obey him. He believes he is the first man ever to call
					a woman “dearest one.” She offers her body to him in submission
					by gesturing that she belongs to him.

The Golden One urges Equality 7-2521 to
					come into the field where it is cooler, but he refuses to cross
					the hedge, so she brings him water to drink. She holds the water
					in her hands and holds her hands to his lips, and they stand that
					way for several moments after he has finished drinking. Even though
					their conversation remains undiscovered by the others in the field,
					they each back away, confused by their intimate gesture.

Equality 7-2521’s break with society
					manifests itself in both explicit and more subtle, structural ways.
					With the discovery of electricity, Equality 7-2521 moves
					away from his musings on the state of his society and less frequently
					exhorts the Councils to forgive him. Instead, he writes with newfound
					fervor for his scientific exploration. This shift signifies his
					increasing independence from the society around him because it shows
					him finding truth in the external world rather than in the opinions
					of others. Nevertheless, at this point in the novella, Equality 7-2521 still
					worries about the conventions of society, especially about the fact
					that his discoveries are his alone. Later, he breaks entirely with
					such conventions, but here he still doubts what he thinks he knows
					about himself and the world around him. Such doubts allow us to
					witness the slow and gradual process of his leaving society.

The content of the conversations that Equality 7-2521 has
					with others constitutes important markers of his progress toward
					an eventual break from his society. Because these conversations
					are rare—Anthem consists almost entirely of musings
					about the state of the natural and human world and thus often bears
					resemblance to a scientific journal or a religious meditation—they
					gain even greater significance in their function as expressions
					of individual will. Equality 7-2521’s conversation
					with International 4-8818 in Chapter I demonstrates
					Equality 7-2521’s willingness to break the
					law in pursuit of truth. His conversation with the Golden One here
					builds upon his growing desire for freedom from the society that
					constrains him. His calling her “dearest one,” which evidences his increasing
					attraction to her, demonstrates his willingness to break the law
					in the pursuit of love.

The conversation between the Golden One and Equality 7-2521 is
					rife with biblical imagery, both in their naming of each other and her
					giving him water to cool him. Naming, the original power of man
					in Genesis, makes the Golden One and Equality 7-2521 more intimate
					with each other and establishes their possession of each other.
					Interestingly, though Liberty 5-3000 is referred
					to throughout Anthem as “the Golden One,” the name
					Equality 7-2521 assigns to her, her name
					for him does not appear again in the text. Feminists argue that
					this disparity marks the fundamental inequality in Rand’s view of
					men and women, though Rand might say that the issue is entirely
					stylistic: after all, Equality 7-2521 is
					writing the text, and it would be hard to incorporate the Golden
					One’s name for him into the text in a meaningful way. 

The offering of water is important both because it represents the Golden
					One’s assumption of the role of caretaker and also because it is
					laden with biblical imagery. In offering water to Equality 7-2521,
					the Golden One adopts a role as caretaker and comfort-giver—a role
					feminists might argue Rand prescribes for her out of a heightened
					sense of the traditional roles of women. The offering of water is
					significant also, however, because it is an image very common in
					the Judeo-Christian Bible. According to the New Testament, Jesus
					Christ often asked and received water from townspeople he met in
					his travels, and the sharing of water is considered to be a virtue,
					as it represents the giving of life-sustaining respite from the
					heat and weariness of travel. Notably, Christ usually made followers
					of those who gave him water to drink. In this case, the Golden One’s giving
					water to Equality 7-2521 accompanies her
					conversion into obedience of him, represents her comforting of him,
					and is also shot through with sexual overtones. As she nurtures
					Equality 7-2521, he desires her and she desires
					him shamelessly for the first time in the novella. Rand seems to
					be conjoining the conversion experience and the sexual experience
					into one baffling moment of ecstasy.
