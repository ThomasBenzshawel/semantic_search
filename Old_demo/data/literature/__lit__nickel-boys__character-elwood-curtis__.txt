Elwood Curtis is the protagonist of the novel, and he is primarily motivated by a deep desire for justice. Elwood fundamentally believes that hard work and dedication will provide opportunities for upward mobility, and he clings to this notion even in the face of obstacles and adversity, such as the time that men take advantage of him in the hotel restaurant to get him to do their work. The words of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his teacher, Mr. Hill, inspire Elwood to get involved in the Civil Rights Movement. His participation in a protest gives him the feeling of unity and camaraderie that he longed for before and continues to pine for after. Elwood’s desire to work toward justice comes at the expense of his own personal safety, which he shows when he confronts two candy-stealing kids while working in Mr. Marconi’s store. To Elwood, ignoring injustice would degrade his personal dignity.

When Elwood arrives at the Nickel Academy because of a grave injustice, he still holds on to his sense of hope and optimism. He believes that working hard to follow the rules and earn merits will allow him to “graduate” quickly. He learns that at Nickel, trying to do what’s right won’t get him ahead, just as it didn’t get him ahead in the outside world. Elwood is beaten for trying to stick up for another boy. It isn’t until Elwood suffers in solitary confinement that he truly begins to lose hope and doubt the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. However, Turner’s willingness to help Elwood escape reignites his hope and optimism, which he clings to until he is killed by Harper.
