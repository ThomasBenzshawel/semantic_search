During a bullfight, the first matador is speared in his sword hand by the horn of a bull. The bull gores the next matador in the stomach. Then, the third matador has to kill all five bulls because in a bullfight, only three matadors are allowed to try to beat the bulls. This matador gets four. Then, the last one gives him trouble because his arm is so tired. Eventually he gets the bull. When he finishes, he sits down and throws up. Someone covers him as people throw things into the ring.

Much of Hemingway's writing features bullfighting. For Hemingway, this game seems to be one of the manliest sports around. The bulls are extremely masculine and the matadors must be even more so to kill them. This story, then, reintroduces the notion of manliness. Because the war is over, men must prove their masculinity in some other way.
