Wang Lung’s oldest son is in many ways similar to Wang
				Lung himself. The primary difference is that Wang Lung was raised
				in poverty, and his son is raised in luxury. Like Wang Lung, the
				oldest son is focused and ambitious—but whereas Wang Lung only desires
				to obtain wealth and respectability, his son desires to become a
				great scholar and live a life of splendor. Wang Lung and his son
				both show outward signs of respecting their elders, but while Wang
				Lung truly believes in the custom of filial piety, his son merely
				pays it lip service, not truly caring about the needs of the older
				generation. This difference in their respect for elders is an example
				of the general difference between Wang Lung and his son: Wang Lung
				retains his connection to tradition even while craving wealth and
				advancement, whereas his son has no interest in what he considers
				quaint and outmoded ethical ideas, and feels free to live only for
				himself.
