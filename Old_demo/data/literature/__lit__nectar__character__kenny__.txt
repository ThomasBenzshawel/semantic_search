Not only does Kenny cry out against injustice and poverty, he takes what
				actions he can to fight against them. He questions the status quo and exhorts
				the suffering to call for help. Sometimes his questions are na√Øve, such as when
				he remonstrates with Rukmani for taking dung out of the fields or for nursing
				her child past the age of weaning. Kenny does not always understand the severe
				marginality of the impoverished, yet Rukmani admires his gentle ways and tender
				heart. He brings western medicine to the village and helps both Rukmani and Ira
				conceive children, their greatest desire. Kenny sacrifices his wife and children
				to his calling in India and lives a lonely, isolated life. He helps others
				however he can, securing work in the city for Murugan and training Selvam as his
				assistant. He raises money by appealing to the humanity of the outside world and
				is tireless in building a hospital for the village. He is determined, says
				Rukmani, to find ways and means. In the novel, Kenny stands for hope.
