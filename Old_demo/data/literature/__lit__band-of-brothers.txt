Band of Brothers is Stephen E. Ambrose’s 1992 historical non-fiction recounting of the involvement of the legendary Easy Company of the 506th Airborne Division in World War II— from training in Camp Toccoa, Georgia through to their liberation of Europe and occupation of Germany. Thanks to accounts collected from surviving members of Easy Company, readers are given an intimate and honest retelling of what it was like to be a part of the war as told through the eyes of American soldiers who served. Band of Brothers was adapted into a hugely popular 10-episode HBO miniseries dramatization in 2001.
