Cacambo sheds a subtle and interesting light on the philosophical themes
				of the novel. Unlike any other character in the novel, he inspires
				perfect confidence, both in his intelligence and his moral uprightness.
				He knows both native American and European languages, and deals
				capably with both the Jesuits and the Biglugs. He suffers fewer
				gross misfortunes than any other character, less out of luck than
				because of his sharp wits, and he lives up to Candide’s trust when
				Candide sends him to fetch Cunégonde. Any reader tempted to conclude
				that Voltaire has no faith in human nature must reconsider when
				faced with the example of Cacambo. Despite the optimism Cacambo
				inspires, however, he is no optimist himself. His wide experience
				of the world has led Cacambo to conclude that “the law of nature
				teaches us to kill our neighbor.”
