Throughout the book, Quintana primarily functions as a
				device through which Didion analyzes her feelings about grief, memory, and
				the relationship between parents and children. Didion presents Quintana—from
				her biographical details to the quirks of her personality—through
				the prism of her personal memories of her daughter, rather than
				showing the reader the live, adult Quintana as a fully-realized
				character in her own right. Quintana functions in her mother’s memoir
				much as the character of Cat does in John Dunne’s novel True
					Confessions: that is, as a composite of memories and sayings
				interpreted through a literary lens but ultimately distinct from
				the actual person. Didion never shows the reader who Quintana really
				is, preferring instead to analyze her relationship with her daughter
				in the broadest terms. Though the logic behind this decision may
				be purely practical, as a way of protecting the privacy of her late
				daughter and her daughter’s husband Gerry, the result is a feeling
				of deep affinity for Quintana without a corresponding understanding
				of who she was a person. Since Quintana spends most of the book
				in either a coma or a state of slow recovery, it makes sense that
				Didion rarely interacts with her in a way that would allow us to
				better understand Quintana. However, this literary strategy also
				keeps the book’s focus on Didion’s relationship with John, allowing
				Quintana’s presence to illustrate more abstract ideas about motherhood
				and family. Quintana’s death, a tragic postscript to the events
				of the memoir, only makes her apparent road to recovery in the final
				chapters all the more emotionally resonant and painful.
