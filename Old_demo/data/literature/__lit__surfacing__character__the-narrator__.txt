Atwood avoids naming the narrator of Surfacing in order
				to emphasize the universality of the narrator’s feeling of alienation from
				society. The causes and effects of the narrator’s psychological transformation
				remain somewhat mysterious. The narrator feels emotionally numb, isolated by the
				numerous roles she is supposed to play in her life. Part of the cause is grief,
				and part of it is due to spending too much time in the wilderness. But the
				narrator’s madness also stems in large part from systematic social alienation.
				Atwood explores a woman’s place in all of its facets: as a human, a wife, a
				religious person, a mother, and a sexual being. The narrator’s madness seems to
				arise from her anger at all of the standard roles forced upon women. Her
				response to this alienation is to become an animal. She sees animals not as
				beasts without reason, but as graceful creatures that are better than humans at
				peacefully coexisting with nature. The result of the narrator’s transformation
				is a greater understanding of her place in society. This understanding comes out
				of necessity, because the narrator realizes that complete withdrawal from
				society will result in her death. However, the narrator also reaches new
				conclusions about how she will cope with society’s ills. She resolves to rejoin
				society without succumbing to the pressures that once subdued her.
