Lorraine is the primary character in the “The Two.” A thin, light-skinned woman, Lorraine is much more sensitive to the prejudices and judgments passed on her than is her partner, Theresa. Lorraine is the ideal resident in every regard. A kind neighbor and schoolteacher, Lorraine embodies the best ideals of domestic stability. She is a faithful and loving spouse to Theresa, and, despite the obvious bias against her, she still tries to be a part of Brewster Place’s tenants’ association. Regardless of Lorraine’s qualities as an individual, the women of Brewster Place, Sophie in particular, treat her harshly. She is viewed as a threat to her community, not because of any real threat that she may pose but because of her sexuality. Lorraine’s mere presence is able to draw out the deep-seated insecurities the other women of Brewster Place keep buried within themselves. The irony surrounding Lorraine is that her relationship with a woman is more stable and loving than any of the other relationships explored in the narrative.
