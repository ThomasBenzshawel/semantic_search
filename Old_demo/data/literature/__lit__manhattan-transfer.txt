Manhattan Transfer is a novel published by John Dos Passos in 1925. Dos Passos uses individual vignettes to tell the stories of characters living in New York City before and after World War I and during Prohibition. The novel portrays the city as a gritty and unrelentingly fast-paced place where happiness is elusive and wealth, youth, and luck are the keys to superficial success during the Jazz Age in New York. Dos Passos was likely inspired by James Joyce’s Ulysses and T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, as Manhattan Transfer displays modernist writing techniques evident in those works.
