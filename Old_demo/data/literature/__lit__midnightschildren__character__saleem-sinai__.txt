Saleem Sinai is the protagonist and narrator of Midnight’s
					Children. He is born, along with one other child, at the
				exact moment of India’s independence. His identity, however, is
				switched at birth. As a result, he is raised by a prosperous family
				in Bombay, while his counterpart and future rival, Shiva, is raised
				in poverty. Saleem has the powers of telepathy and a preternaturally
				acute sense of smell, which allow him to find the other children
				of midnight and create the Midnight’s Children’s Conference. As
				he approaches his thirty-first birthday, he says he is nearing death.
				His body is literally falling apart, and it’s only a matter of time
				before he crumbles into dust. Driven by a desire to beat his biological
				clock, Saleem narrates his life story to his devoted and loving
				caretaker, Padma. His tale, which begins with his grandfather Aadam
				and is at times unreliable and contrived, represents not only his
				individual life story but also the entire history of postcolonial
				India. All the major events in his life correspond to important
				political events in Indian history, leading him to compare his narrative
				to religious texts. Given his fantastic birth and extraordinary
				powers, the prime minister of India, Indira Ghandi, seeks to destroy
				him along with the other midnight’s children.
