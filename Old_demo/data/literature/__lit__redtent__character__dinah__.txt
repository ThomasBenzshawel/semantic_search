Dinah is the first daughter born to a polygamous family
				that includes four mothers and eleven sons. As the long-awaited
				daughter, she is spoiled, adored, and given special treatment and
				attention from her multiple mothers. She enjoys her special status
				and occasionally uses the jealousy between Leah and Rachel to her
				advantage: for example, she sleeps in Rachel’s tent when Leah is
				short with her.

Intelligent and lively, Dinah makes up games to play with
				her many brothers. Although most of her brothers are older, she
				often assumes the role of boss and chief storyteller. When the boys
				grow older and move out to the fields with their father, Dinah contentedly spends
				the majority of her time in the tents with the women, as she is
				a keen and diligent observer who takes pleasure in noting their family
				dynamics. As a narrator, she is careful to detail even the subtlest
				actions of her family members but rarely takes such care in describing
				herself. For the majority of Dinah’s life, she describes herself
				as a passive observer, taking little responsibility for the events
				in her life. When Re-nefer takes Dinah’s son as her own, Dinah is
				practically unresponsive, grieving quietly but not defending herself.
				This passiveness is a curious aspect of Dinah’s personality, as
				her mother Leah had been a role model of the strong-minded and assertive woman. 

Over the course of the novel, Dinah grows from being a
				lively but passive girl attached to her mothers to one who an independent, active
				agent in her own life. Although Dinah endures unspeakable grief
				and loss, she rebuilds herself—eventually finding a new home, a
				new husband, and a new family that fulfill her desire for a productive
				and peaceful life.
