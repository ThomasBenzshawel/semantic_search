Passepartout is the counterpoint to Fogg’s reserved, cold exterior. Passepartout is lively, garrulous, and warm-hearted. He comes to London in search of a quieter life as a servant, which alludes to a rowdier past life back home in France. When Passepartout finds himself passed out on the deck a ship from a night of drinking, he’s reminded of his past and shudders. Passepartout is clearly determined to reform himself. In his past, Passepartout held many jobs, including circus performer, gym teacher, and fireman. Over time, he developed a well-rounded, muscular, able body that serves him well during his and Fogg’s adventure. Passepartout is also quick-thinking and resourceful. Passepartout’s lively, social nature sometimes gets him into trouble, as he isn’t always aware of when he should stop talking and sometimes lets details slip that he should not. Passepartout’s qualities balance those of Fogg, and together, they form a formidable team on their journey. By the end of the story, Passepartout realizes he possesses great loyalty and even risks his life to save Fogg, whom he views as a friend, not just as a master.
