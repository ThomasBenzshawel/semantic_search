Hester’s daughter, Pearl, functions primarily as a symbol.
She is quite young during most of the events of this novel—when
Dimmesdale dies she is only seven years old—and her real importance
lies in her ability to provoke the adult characters in the book.
She asks them pointed questions and draws their attention, and the
reader’s, to the denied or overlooked truths of the adult world.
In general, children in The Scarlet Letter are
portrayed as more perceptive and more honest than adults, and Pearl
is the most perceptive of them all.

Pearl makes us constantly aware of her mother’s scarlet
letter and of the society that produced it. From an early age, she
fixates on the emblem. Pearl’s innocent, or perhaps intuitive, comments
about the letter raise crucial questions about its meaning. Similarly,
she inquires about the relationships between those around her—most important,
the relationship between Hester and Dimmesdale—and offers perceptive
critiques of them. Pearl provides the text’s harshest, and most
penetrating, judgment of Dimmesdale’s failure to admit to his adultery.
Once her father’s identity is revealed, Pearl is no longer needed
in this symbolic capacity; at Dimmesdale’s death she becomes fully
“human,” leaving behind her otherworldliness and her preternatural
vision.
