Tyurin, a foreman at the labor camp, is tough
				and heroic. Shukhov notes that Tyurin does not even squint when
				the fierce icy Siberian wind blows straight into his face. At the
				beginning of the novel, Tyurin is a distant and terrifying authority
				figure, associated with the dread of punishment. But he transforms
				into a more sympathetic character when, at the Power Station, he
				narrates his life history. Tyurin’s shift from an imposing authoritarian
				to an accessible comrade shows the humanity hidden deep within even
				the fiercest Soviet law enforcers.

Tyurin’s character shows the camp’s lack of
				justice since, like everyone else in the camp, he has been thrown
				into prison without deserving this fate. Tyurin is a prisoner only
				because his father belonged to the kulak, or rich
				peasant, class that Stalin has vowed to exterminate. Like almost
				everyone else in the camp, Tyurin is an essentially good person
				unfairly condemned to a life of misery. Tyurin’s misery is compounded
				by the fact that he is not part of a social group in the camp. His
				experience shows us that the life of a camp officer may be even
				worse than that of a common prisoner. Without the community or camaraderie
				of the prisoners, Tyurin is treated as a representative of the state
				and feared as a Soviet authority, even though he is still a prison inmate
				like the others.
