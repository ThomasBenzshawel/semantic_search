This list of supporting characters—a list that could easily
be extended—may seem inconsistent. Indeed, there are plenty of reasons
why black family members of Richard’s do not belong in a list with
white racists like Pease and Reynolds, and why city-dwelling black
Communists like Ed Green and Buddy Nealson do not belong with the
other characters either. With respect to Richard, though, all of
these characters are part of the same group: they all ascribe to inflexible
attitudes and beliefs that do not accommodate differing opinions
from independently minded people like Richard.

	In the cases of Granny and Addie, strict religious faith
drives them to attack Richard at every turn because he fails to
act like a good Seventh-Day Adventist. Tom’s belief that young people
should unthinkingly obey their elders rouses him to fury whenever
Richard takes a justified stand against him. Pease, Reynolds, and
Olin believe that black people exist merely for the service and
sport of white people, leading them to treat Richard with shocking
inhumanity. Finally, Ed Green and Buddy Nealson, who maintain that Communists
should quietly march in step with the Party, vilify Richard as soon
as he seems to be marching to a different drummer.

	In short, these characters all deny Richard’s worth as
an individual. The American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote
in Self-Reliance that “[s]ociety everywhere is
in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members,”
in that the “base doctrine of the majority of voices usurps the
place of the doctrine of the soul.” Taken together, these characters
represent the multitude of ways in which society “is in conspiracy
against” Richard.
