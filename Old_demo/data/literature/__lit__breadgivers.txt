Bread Givers, published in 1925 by Anzia Yezierska, is a semi-autobiographical novel that tells the story of Sara Smolinsky, a young Russian-Jewish immigrant from what is now Poland, growing up in the Lower East Side of New York City in the early 20th century. Sara’s father is a religious scholar who refuses to work, leaving his wife and daughters to support the family. Sara’s struggle to break free from her father’s oppressive influence and to achieve independence drives the novel.
