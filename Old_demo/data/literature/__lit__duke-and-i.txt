American author Julia Quinn’s The Duke and I, published in 2000, is the first in an eight-book series about the Bridgerton family, with each novel focusing on one of the family’s eight siblings. The Regency-era historical romance hit the New York Times extended bestseller list as well as both the Publishers Weekly and USA Today bestseller lists following its inital release. The Duke and I has been translated into 39 languages and the novel was adapted into a Netflix series produced by Shonda Rhimes in 2020. The show was a critical and commercial hit and prompted renewed interest in the novel, once again earning The Duke and I a place on major bestseller lists for several months. The series also spawned a set of four prequels focusing on the Rokesby family, beginning with Because of Miss Bridgerton.
