Linda and Charley serve as forces of reason throughout
				the play. Linda is probably the most enigmatic and complex character
				in Death of a Salesman, or even in all of Miller’s
				work. Linda views freedom as an escape from debt, the reward of
				total ownership of the material goods that symbolize success and
				stability. Willy’s prolonged obsession with the American Dream seems,
				over the long years of his marriage, to have left Linda internally
				conflicted. Nevertheless, Linda, by far the toughest, most realistic,
				and most levelheaded character in the play, appears to have kept
				her emotional life intact. As such, she represents the emotional
				core of the drama.

If Linda is a sort of emotional prophet, overcome by the
				inevitable end that she foresees with startling clarity, then Charley
				functions as a sort of poetic prophet or sage. Miller portrays Charley
				as ambiguously gendered or effeminate, much like Tiresias, the mythological
				seer in Sophocles’ Oedipus plays. Whereas Linda’s
				lucid diagnosis of Willy’s rapid decline is made possible by her
				emotional sanity, Charley’s prognosis of the situation is logical,
				grounded firmly in practical reasoned analysis. He recognizes Willy’s
				financial failure, and the job offer that he extends to Willy constitutes
				a commonsense solution. Though he is not terribly fond of Willy,
				Charley understands his plight and shields him from blame.
