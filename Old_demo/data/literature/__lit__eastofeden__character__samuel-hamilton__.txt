As the gentle, selfless patriarch of the Hamilton family,
				Samuel stands in sharp contrast to Cyrus, the dishonest patriarch
				of the Trask family. Whereas Cyrus introduces a legacy of sin into
				his family by passing down a stolen inheritance, the good-natured
				Samuel—who, notably, never is wealthy—passes down an inheritance of
				close familial love and devotion. Like the biblical Samuel, who was
				a prophet, Samuel Hamilton displays intuition and foresight and
				often tells Adam Trask truths that are difficult to hear. Samuel sees
				through Cathy immediately and is chilled by her inhumanity and Adam’s
				ignorance of it. After the twins are born and Cathy flees, Samuel
				counsels Adam and helps him overcome his melancholy. Although Samuel
				is not a violent man, he reluctantly resorts to force in order to
				jolt Adam out of his stupor and to convince Adam to give the boys
				names, which they go without for more than a year. Later, shortly
				before he dies of old age, Samuel tells Adam the difficult truth
				that Cathy is still living in Salinas and working at a brothel. Although
				this revelation causes Adam pain, it ultimately enables him to confront
				the reality of Cathy’s evil and escape from her power.
