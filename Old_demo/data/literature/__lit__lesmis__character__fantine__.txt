Although all of Fantine’s misfortunes are caused by the
				callousness or greed of others, society always holds her accountable
				for her behavior. In this sense, she embodies Hugo’s view that French
				society demands the most from those to whom it gives the least.
				Fantine is a poor, working-class girl from the desolate seacoast
				town of Montreuil-sur-mer, an orphan who has almost no education
				and can neither read nor write. Fantine is inevitably betrayed by
				the people she does trust: Tholomyès gets her pregnant and then
				disappears; the Thénardiers take Cosette and use the child to extort
				more money; and Fantine’s coworkers have her fired for indecency.
				In his descriptions of Fantine’s life and death, Hugo highlights
				the unfair attitude of French society toward women and the poor.
				Fantine’s fellow citizens criticize her for her behavior and depravity,
				but they also take every opportunity to make her circumstances even
				more desperate.

Hugo’s portrayal of Fantine’s mistreatment distinguishes
				the honest, hardworking poor from the parasitic opportunism of the working-class
				Thénardiers. By juxtaposing Fantine with the Thénardiers, Hugo suggests
				that poverty does not necessarily equal indecency. In doing so,
				he condemns a system that allows the indecent poor to survive even
				as it crushes the honest and needy.
