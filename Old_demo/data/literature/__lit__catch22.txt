Catch-22, published in 1961 by American author Joseph Heller, is a satirical novel that follows the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army B-25 bombardier during World War II. The novel is set on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is based on Heller’s own World War II experiences serving as a bombardier for the United States. Heller’s dark humor and insightful critique make Catch-22 a classic exploration of the surreal and often irrational nature of war and bureaucracy.
