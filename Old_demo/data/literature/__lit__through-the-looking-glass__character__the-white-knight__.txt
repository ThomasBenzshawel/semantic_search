Carroll modeled the character of the White Knight after
				himself, and the White Knight’s compassionate behavior toward Alice
				demonstrates Carroll’s feelings toward the real-life Alice Liddell.
				Like the White Knight, Carroll had shaggy hair, blue eyes, and a
				mild face. Also like Carroll, the White Knight has a penchant for
				inventing and compulsively preparing for any kind of contingency,
				no matter how ridiculous. The White Knight sweeps in at a moment
				of crisis to rescue Alice from the clutches of the Red Knight, before
				he helpfully escorts her to the point at which she no longer needs
				protection and can claim her new title of queen. As he guides her,
				he sings a song that conjures up feelings of wistful longing, calling attention
				to the idea of Alice’s transformation into a queen as a metaphor
				for her sexual awakening into womanhood. The White Knight represents
				a figure from her childhood who can bring her to the point at which
				she reaches adulthood before he must let go. The scene between the
				White Knight and Alice is marked by feelings of nostalgia tinged
				with regret, since Alice must eventually leave the White Knight
				and claim her new role alone.
