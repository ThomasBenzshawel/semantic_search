Polly is the only character who undergoes any significant
				change in the course of the play. When the plays opens, she is a
				young, naïve girl who has fallen in love. She is initially horrified
				by the criminality of her new husband, but gradually she accepts
				the circumstances of Macheath’s business and even agrees to lead
				the gang in his absence. By the time Macheath has escaped from jail,
				Polly has been coarsened enough to try to trick Lucy into revealing
				where Macheath is hiding.

Polly’s relationship with Macheath causes the change within
				her character. She initially experiences his world of depravity
				and criminality with horror. But Polly eventually accepts the brutality
				all around her and helps to make Macheath’s thieves accept her as
				their new boss after Macheath tells them he has to leave. At the
				jailhouse with Lucy, Polly exhibits a toughness that contrasts her
				perceived sweetness. This toughness belies the jealousy that lies
				beneath, and it displays a virtuous girl that has become cruel.

Polly is unwavering in her love for Macheath. She loves
				him at their wedding, when he flees and gets arrested at a whorehouse,
				and even after she learns that he has another woman. This love creates
				a strong conflict with the self-interest that motivates the plot
				of the play. Polly’s love especially conflicts with her parents’
				self-interest, and she represents the possibility of something bigger
				than self-interest.
