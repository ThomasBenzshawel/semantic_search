Circe is Madeline Millerâ€™s 2018 adaptation of the Greek legend of Circe, the witch whom Odysseus encounters in The Odyssey on his journey home from the Trojan War. It is set in the Bronze Age where gods, heroes, and monsters populate the world and where women, even immortal ones, are often powerless. Circe is a complex heroine who struggles to find love, discover her own place in the world, and defy those who seek to oppress her.
