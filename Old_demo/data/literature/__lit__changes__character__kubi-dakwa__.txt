A relatively minor figure in the novel, Kubi Dakwa represents a middle
				ground between Ali and Oko. Although he still acts as and considers himself to
				be the head of the house, he is able to maintain a marriage to a woman as
				strong-willed as Opokuya. He is a selfish character, as evidenced by his
				reluctance to share the car with his wife and by his attempt to sleep with Esi.
				At the same time, however, Kubi also clearly accepts his wifeâ€™s right to
				disagree with him.
