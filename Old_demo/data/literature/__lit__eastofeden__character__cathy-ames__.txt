The parasitic, manipulative Cathy is the embodiment of
				evil in the novel and the most static of the main characters. Her
				evil seems to be innate and all-consuming, as she displays murderous
				and sexually perverse tendencies from an early age. A figure of
				infertility and destruction who kills her parents and attempts to
				kill her own unborn children, Cathy is a debased version of the
				biblical Eve, whom the Christian tradition sees as the mother of
				all humankind. Like Eve, Cathy is associated with sin, but whereas
				Eve is deceived into committing sin, Cathy embraces it wholeheartedly
				and commits evil simply for its own sake. Cathy has an overwhelmingly
				pessimistic view of humankind: she believes that there is only evil
				in the world and therefore surrenders herself to it fully. All the
				while, she fails to understand the good in other characters and
				instead uses their trusting natures to achieve her own predatory
				ends. Notably, we never get any sense that Cathy is using her evil
				acts to reach any sort of ultimate goal or aim. For this reason,
				some critics have dismissed Cathy as an implausible character and
				a major weak link in Steinbeck’s novel. The narrator of East
					of Eden himself is somewhat confounded by Cathy, as he
				struggles to understand her and revises his opinion of her throughout
				the novel. In any case, Cathy is a symbol of the human evil that
				will always be present in the world, and her loss of power over
				Adam and Cal bolsters the novel’s message that individuals have
				the choice to reject evil in favor of good.
