The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Native American novelist Sherman Alexie, published in 2007, is a poignant and humorous coming-of-age novel that follows the journey of Arnold Spirit Jr. (called “Junior”), a young Native American boy living on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington. The novel, presented in a diary format, chronicles Arnold’s decision to attend an all-white high school off the reservation, exploring themes of identity, cultural assimilation, and the pursuit of dreams.

Set against the backdrop of the reservation, the novel provides a candid and sometimes humorous account of Arnold’s struggles with poverty, racism, and the challenges of straddling two distinct worlds. The diary format allows readers to intimately connect with Arnold as he navigates the complexities of adolescence and self-discovery. Published during a time when discussions about diversity and representation were gaining momentum, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian received critical acclaim for its authentic portrayal of the Native American experience. It won the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature in 2007. Alexie’s use of humor and sincerity in addressing challenging topics has contributed to the novel’s lasting impact.
