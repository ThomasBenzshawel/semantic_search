Though he is dead throughout most of Snow Falling
					on Cedars, Carl is a major character in the novel. He embodies
				both the best and worst aspects of the white community on San Piedro.
				A physically strong, hardworking, and stoic man, Carl is San Piedro’s
				ideal citizen. He toils for his family’s welfare, keeps to himself,
				and has largely put the trauma of his war experiences behind him.
				In these respects, Carl is superior to Ishmael, Horace Whaley, Kabuo,
				and the many other San Piedro residents who are only marginal members
				of the community.

Though Carl clearly represents many ideals, he also exemplifies the
				frustrating passivity and closed-mindedness typical of San Piedro’s
				white residents. As we see in his conversations with Kabuo and Susan
				Marie, Carl has an unthinking and reflexive dislike of people of
				Japanese origin, even though he and Kabuo used to be close friends
				as youngsters. Furthermore, Carl is so stoic and emotionally isolated
				that even his wife feels she does not know him well. Even the other
				fishermen, ostensibly Carl’s closest brethren, feel distant from
				him.

	Carl’s importance to the narrative extends beyond his
				contradictions. When Carl agrees to sell the seven acres of land
				to Kabuo, he becomes the first of the novel’s major characters to
				find the strength to put the past behind him. It is ironic, therefore,
				that almost immediately after Carl affirms the power of individual
				morality, he is killed by the most impersonal of forces: chance.
