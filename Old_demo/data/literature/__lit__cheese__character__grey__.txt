Grey, also known as Thompson or #2222, is as mysterious a figure as his multiple names indicate. He protects the Farmers and is quite good at his job, helping to foil the two murder attempts. All along, Grey hides his real intent—to make sure David has revealed all possible information from his testimony. His personal stake in the matter suggests that the information could possibly harm him, although this is never explicitly stated. Grey becomes a fixture in the Farmers' lives, but his presence is somehow invisible too. Grey's status as a cipher—or a "nothing," as Adam calls him—is what he eventually turns the Farmers into, as well: humans who have little residue of their own identities.
