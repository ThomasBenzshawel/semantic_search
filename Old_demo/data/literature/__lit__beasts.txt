Bless the Beasts and Children, a 1970 coming-of-age novel by Glendon Swarthout, follows a group of six boys at a summer camp in Arizona as they embark on a mission to save a herd of buffalo from slaughter by a group of hunters. Swarthout uses the boys’ adventure to delve into themes of youthful rebellion, the search for belonging, and the clash between societal norms and individual morality. The novel becomes a deeply moving exploration of masculinity, friendship, and the fight against injustice. In 1971 Bless the Beasts and Children was adapted into a film directed by Stanley Kramer that featured a hit title song by the pop group The Carpenters.
