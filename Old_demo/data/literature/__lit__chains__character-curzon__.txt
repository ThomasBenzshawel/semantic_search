Curzon is immediately fond of Isabel when they meet on the dock when Isabel arrives in New York, and her friendship with him becomes the most important relationship in the novel. Curzon is always helpful to Isabel, even when she refuses to speak with him after her branding. He wants to protect Isabel, but he cannot. However, Curzon looks out for Isabel’s well-being and gives her advice.

Curzon is dedicated to the patriots’ cause and risks his life to support it by joining the rebel soldiers. He believes that a free United States will free the enslaved people, and he certainly believes that the rebels deserve to be free. Like Isabel, Curzon is courageous. He gets shot through the leg, yet he holds on and begins to recover while in prison. He does not give in to despair or death despite infection, pain, and abuse.

Curzon is the one who first suggests to Isabel and then convinces her to support the rebels. He all but promises that if she does, men like Bellingham, his master, and officers such as Regan and Morse will help her locate the document that will set her free: Mary Finch’s will. Despite his promises, Curzon has no power of his own to make this happen. However, by novel’s end, Isabel is the one to fulfill Curzon’s promise of freedom, as she smuggles him out of prison and they escape to freedom.
