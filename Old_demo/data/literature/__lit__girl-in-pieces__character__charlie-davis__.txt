Content Warning: The below contains references to self-harm.

The novel’s protagonist, Charlie, is a 17-year-old girl whose life has left her scarred psychologically, emotionally, and physically. Her challenge is to learn to live clean and sober without relying on other people for validation, blaming herself for other people’s bad decisions, or using self-harm to cope with her problems. After being discharged from the rehab center, Charlie is forced to build a life where she is responsible for not only her basic survival needs, but also her emotional and psychological well-being. She initially looks to Mikey to be not only her caregiver but also her romantic partner. When he is unable to do this, Charlie changes her approach, instead taking on a supportive role for Riley, helping him feed and conceal his addiction while she puts her own needs aside. This approach doesn’t get her the love and connection she craves, and it isn’t until Blue, Linus, Tanner, and Felix encourage her to communicate her emotions that she is able to forge a life for herself. By connecting her emotions with her art, Charlie learns to manage her self-destructive tendencies and develop as an artist and an independent person.
