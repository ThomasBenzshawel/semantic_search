Sofia is the youngest daughter and as a result does not
				have many clear memories of life in the Dominican Republic. She
				does remember the Haitian maid, Chucha, who performed voodoo spells.
				When she got older, she had "non-stop boyfriends," ran off with
				Otto from Germany, and developed a tense and at times openly hostile relationship
				with her father. After a failed relationship with a Dominican boyfriend,
				she embraces American attitudes toward sexual relationships. She
				challenges sexual double standards that she finds to be more pronounced
				in traditional Dominican culture and claims her sexual independence.
				She and her father begin to reconcile when she had her children,
				but at his birthday party she continues to flaunt her sexuality
				and his powerlessness to control it by kissing his ear in a particularly
				seductive way.
