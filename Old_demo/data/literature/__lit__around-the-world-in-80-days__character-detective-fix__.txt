Detective Fix is an archetypal officer of the law in any adventure story: out to catch the bad guy, no matter what. He proves he is just as determined as Fogg to reach a goal. When Fix hears of Fogg’s bet shortly after receiving the news that a robber dressed as a gentleman has stolen 55,000 pounds from the Bank of England, Fix assumes that Fogg is the robber and spreads a rumor that fuels his search for Fogg. Fix is a man of his times, working the media to achieve his goal. Fix chases Fogg across the world as he waits for the arrest warrant to catch up with them. Fix’s motivations are not completely pure, however: He’s hoping to claim the 2,000 pounds and 5 percent of the stolen money that’s being offered for the robber’s capture. When Fix witnesses several acts of Fogg’s kindness and generosity, his assumptions about Fogg are challenged. Is Fogg really a criminal? Fogg even pays for Fix’s lodging and fares on several occasions. These incidents challenge Fix’s morality and ethics as well as his adaptability of mind. However, like his namesake, Fix remains “fixed” on his impression of Fogg and won’t change his mind, reconciling his conscience with the idea that Fogg “owes” him for making him travel such a great distance.
