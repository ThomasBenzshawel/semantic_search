The Book of Margery Kempe is the autobiography of 15th century English Christian mystic Margery Kempe first published around 1500. Dictated to an unnamed priest, this important English mystical work documents the spiritual life of a fascinating and controversial woman while providing an intimate look at a life in medieval Europe. The Book of Margery Kempe describes Margeryâ€™s interactions with her husband and some of her 14 children as well as with Catholic Church officials who react to her with a combination of skepticism and awe as she travels around England and throughout medieval Europe on religious pilgrimages.
