Lancelot is the protagonist of Book III and the greatest
				knight in the company of the Round Table. He is Arthur’s best friend
				and a powerful foil for the king since he is complex and full of
				contradictions. Lancelot is also Arthur’s opposite in that, while
				he is always able to take swift and decisive action, he is rarely
				able to use this ability to make the world a better place. Even
				when Lancelot performs a heroic deed, he does so accidentally, not
				because he has heroic ideals or good intentions. Lancelot’s ugliness
				gives him a sense of unworthiness and inadequacy from a very young
				age, but this low self-esteem is paired with an astonishing, almost
				unnatural talent for all knightly skills and endeavors. The ease
				with which Lancelot wins glory as a knight, combined with his gnawing
				sense of inferiority, is the source of most of his contradictions.
				Lancelot is both religious and lustful, both hideous and exalted,
				both meek and violent. He is simultaneously Arthur’s best friend
				and betrayer.

Lancelot is a prisoner of such contradictions. His own
				complexity keeps him from growing as a person, since he is too humble
				to exalt in his success and allow it to improve his self-image.
				Cutting through all of these contradictions is Lancelot’s unyielding,
				passionate love for Guenever; ultimately, their affair becomes both
				the best and the worst thing to happen to him. Lancelot’s love for
				Guenever provides Lancelot with moments of bliss but also compounds
				his guilt and leads to his downfall.
