Todd Strasser’s 1981 YA novel The Wave follows the rapid rise of a fascistic, cult-like movement that sweeps through a fictional yet typical American high school when a teacher conducts a classroom experiment designed to simulate life in Nazi Germany and shed light on German citizens’ behavior at that time. The work is a novelization of a 1981 TV movie (also called The Wave) written by screenwriter Johnny Dawkins. The novel and the TV movie were based on the real-life “The Third Wave” social experiment created by teacher Ron Jones in a high school in Palo Alto, California, in 1967.
