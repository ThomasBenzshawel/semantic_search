When Harry first meets the Weasleys on the train to Hogwarts, Ron is anxious about starting a new school, particularly under the mocking eye of his older brothers. Ron worries he will not live up to his family’s reputation at Hogwarts, and he is unsure how many of his brothers’ stories are trustworthy. Like Harry, Ron is not entirely sure what to expect at Hogwarts. The Weasleys are from a wizarding family, so Ron knows wizarding culture and at least the basics of Harry’s history with Voldemort, even if he has not learned how to use magic himself. Despite coming from a long line of wizards, the Weasleys are not wealthy, nor do they hold the same sense of superiority as other wizarding families like the Malfoys.

Ron is initially shocked to discover he’s sitting on the train with Harry Potter, but after seeing Harry’s scar, Ron is not particularly starstruck. Harry is grateful for Ron’s normalcy and the two hit it off like ordinary eleven-year-old boys. They learn together, form opinions of their peers together, and get into mischief together. Ron becomes Harry’s way into the wizarding world, helping to educate him about Quidditch, wizard’s chess, and chocolate frog collections. Ron also proves to be a loyal friend, sticking by Harry through the highs and lows.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione tackle the various obstacles protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone, Ron’s strength is his ability to strategize. He expertly maneuvers them through the giant wizard’s chess game and continues to prove his loyalty by sacrificing himself so that the other two can move forward. While Ron can be impulsive—such as when he volunteers Harry for a wizard’s duel or beats up Malfoy in the Quidditch stands—his actions are almost always in support of his friends.
