A furious storm overtakes Candide’s ship on its
					way to Lisbon. Jacques tries to save a sailor who has almost fallen
					overboard. He saves the sailor but falls overboard himself, and
					the sailor does nothing to help him. The ship sinks, and Pangloss,
					Candide, and the sailor are the only survivors. They reach shore
					and walk toward Lisbon.

	Lisbon has just experienced a terrible earthquake and
					is in ruins. The sailor finds some money in the ruins and promptly
					gets drunk and pays a woman for sex. Meanwhile the groans of dying
					and buried victims rise from the ruins. Pangloss and Candide help
					the wounded, and Pangloss comforts the victims by telling them the earthquake
					is for the best. One of the officers of the Inquisition accuses
					Pangloss of heresy because an optimist cannot possibly believe in
					original sin. The fall and punishment of man, the Catholic Inquisitor
					claims, prove that everything is not for the best. Through some
					rather twisted logic, Pangloss attempts to defend his theory.

The Portuguese authorities decide to burn a few people
					alive to prevent future earthquakes. They choose one man because
					he has married his godmother, and two others because they have refused
					to eat bacon (thus presumably revealing themselves to be Jewish).
					The authorities hang Pangloss for his opinions and publicly flog
					Candide for “listening with an air of approval.” When another earthquake
					occurs later the same day, Candide finds himself doubting that this
					is the best of all possible worlds.

Just then an old woman approaches Candide, treats his
					wounds, gives him new clothes, and feeds him. After two days, she
					leads him to a house in the country to meet his real benefactor,
					Cunégonde.

Cunégonde explains to Candide that the Bulgars have killed
					her family. After executing a soldier whom he found raping Cunégonde, a
					Bulgar captain took Cunégonde as his mistress and later sold her to
					a Jew, Don Issachar. After seeing her at Mass, the Grand Inquisitor
					wanted to buy her from Don Issachar; when Don Issachar refused,
					the Grand Inquisitor threatened him with auto-da-fé (burning alive).
					The two agreed to share Cunégonde; the Grand Inquisitor would have
					her four days a week, Don Issachar the other three. Cunégonde was
					present to see Pangloss hanged and Candide whipped, the horror of
					which made her doubt Pangloss’s teachings. Cunégonde told the old
					woman, her servant, to care for Candide and bring him to her.

Don Issachar arrives to find Cunégonde and
					Candide alone together, and attacks Candide in a jealous rage. Candide
					kills Don Issachar with a sword given to him by the old woman. The Grand
					Inquisitor arrives to enjoy his allotted time with Cunégonde and
					is surprised to find Candide. Candide kills him. Cunégonde gathers
					her jewels and three horses from the stable and flees with Candide
					and the old woman. The Holy Brotherhood gives the Grand Inquisitor
					a grand burial, but throws Don Issachar’s body on a dunghill.

A Franciscan friar steals Cunégonde’s jewels.
					Despite his agreement with Pangloss’s philosophy that “the fruits
					of the earth are a common heritage of all,” Candide nonetheless
					laments the loss. Candide and Cunégonde sell one horse and travel
					to Cadiz, where they find troops preparing to sail to the New World.
					Paraguayan Jesuit priests have incited an Indian tribe to rebel
					against the kings of Spain and Portugal. Candide demonstrates his
					military experience to the general, who promptly makes him a captain.
					Candide takes Cunégonde, the old woman, and the horses with him,
					and predicts that it is the New World that will prove to be the
					best of all possible worlds. But Cunégonde claims to have suffered
					so much that she has almost lost all hope. The old woman admonishes
					Cunégonde for complaining because Cunégonde has not suffered as
					much as she has.

Readers have proposed various interpretations of Jacques’s
					death. His death could represent Voltaire’s criticism of the optimistic
					belief that evil is always balanced by good. Jacques, who is good,
					perishes while saving the sailor, who is selfish and evil; the result
					is not a balance but a case of evil surviving good. Jacques’s death
					could also represent the uselessness of Christian values. Continually
					referred to as “the Anabaptist,” Jacques is an altruist who does
					not change society for the better; he ends up a victim of his own
					altruism.

	Pangloss responds to Jacques’s death by asserting that
					the bay outside Lisbon had been formed “expressly for this Anabaptist
					to drown in.” This argument is a parody of the complacent reasoning of
					optimistic philosophers. Convinced that the world God created must
					necessarily be perfectly planned and executed, optimists end up
					drawing far-fetched and unlikely connections between apparently
					unrelated events, such as the formation of a bay and the drowning
					of Jacques.

	Voltaire bases the earthquake in Candide on
					an actual historical event that affected him deeply. A devastating
					earthquake on November 1, 1755—All Saints’
					Day—leveled Lisbon and killed over 30,000 people,
					many of whom died while praying in church. The earthquake challenged
					a number of Enlightenment thinkers’ optimistic views of the world.

	The sailor’s debauchery amid the groans of the wounded
					represents indifference in the face of evil. Voltaire strongly condemned indifference,
					and his belief that human inaction allows suffering to continue
					is evident in his depictions of the sailor and Pangloss. At one
					point, when Candide is knocked down by rubble and begs Pangloss
					to bring him wine and oil, Pangloss ignores Candide’s request and
					rambles on about the causes and ultimate purpose of the earthquake.
					Voltaire proposes a fundamental similarity between Pangloss’s behavior
					and the sailor’s actions. The sailor’s sensual indulgence in the
					face of death is grotesque and inhumane. While less grotesque, Pangloss’s
					philosophizing is no better, because it too gets in the way of any
					meaningful, useful response to the disaster.

	The auto-da-fé, or act of faith, was the Inquisition’s
					practice of burning heretics alive. Beginning in the Middle Ages,
					the officials of the Inquisition systematically tortured and murdered
					tens of thousands of people on the slightest suspicion of heresy
					against orthodox Christian doctrine. Jews, Protestants, Muslims,
					and accused witches were victims of this organized campaign of violence.
					Like many Enlightenment intellectuals, Voltaire was appalled by
					the barbarism and superstition of the Inquisition, and by the religious
					fervor that inspired it.

	Voltaire makes his ideological priorities clear in Candide. Pangloss’s
					philosophy lacks use and purpose, and often leads to misguided suffering,
					but the Inquisition’s determination to suppress dissenting opinion
					at any cost represents tyranny and unjust persecution. The Inquisition
					authorities twist Pangloss’s words to make them appear to be a direct
					attack on Christian orthodoxy, and flog Candide for merely seeming to
					approve of what Pangloss says. This flogging of Candide represents
					exaggeration on Voltaire’s part, an amplification of the Inquisition’s
					repressive tactics that serves a satirical purpose. Along with outrage
					at the cruelty of the Inquisition, we are encouraged to laugh at
					its irrationality, as well as at the exaggerated nature of Candide’s
					experience.

	Cunégonde’s situation inspires a similarly subversive
					combination of horror and absurdity. Her story demonstrates the
					vulnerability of women to male exploitation and their status as
					objects of possession and barter. Cunégonde is bought and sold like
					a painting or piece of livestock, yet the deadpan calm with which
					she relates her experiences to Candide creates an element of the
					absurd. Candide takes this absurdity further; as Cunégonde describes
					how her Bulgar rapist left a wound on her thigh, Candide interrupts
					to say, “What a pity! I should very much like to see it.” In the
					middle of this litany of dreadful events, Candide’s suggestive comments
					seem ridiculous, but the absurdity provides comic relief from the
					despicably violent crimes that Cunégonde describes.

	The stereotyped representation of the Jew Don Issachar
					may offend the contemporary reader, but it demonstrates the hypocrisy that
					afflicted even such a progressive thinker as Voltaire. Voltaire attacked
					religious persecution throughout his life, but he suffered from
					his own collection of prejudices. In theory, he opposed the persecution
					of Jews, but in practice, he expressed anti-Semitic views of his
					own. In his Dictionary of Philosophy, Voltaire
					describes the Jews as “the most abominable people in the world.”
					Don Issachar’s character is a narrow, mean-spirited stereotype—a
					rich, conniving merchant who deals in the market of human flesh.

	Voltaire makes another attack on religious hypocrisy
					through the character of the Franciscan who steals Cunégonde’s jewels.
					The Franciscan order required a vow of poverty from its members,
					making Voltaire’s choice of that order for his thief especially
					ironic.
