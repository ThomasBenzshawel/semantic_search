Animal Farm by George Orwell, first published in 1945, is a satirical allegory that explores the Russian Revolution and the subsequent rise of Stalinism. Set on a farm, the story begins with the animals overthrowing their human oppressors, led by the pigs who represent the ruling class. Initially, the animals establish a utopian society based on the principles of equality and solidarity. However, as the pigs consolidate power, they betray the very ideals they espoused, turning the farm into a dystopian regime mirroring the oppressive human rule they initially rebelled against.

Orwell’s novella serves as a critique of totalitarianism and the corrupting nature of power. The narrative is a reflection on the cyclical nature of political revolutions and the dangers of blind obedience. The animals’ struggle for freedom and equality parallels historical events, making Animal Farm a timeless and thought-provoking work that resonates with readers across different eras.

Animal Farm has been adapted into various films and plays, with the animated film released in 1954 being one of the most notable. These adaptations contribute to the enduring legacy of Orwell’s work, ensuring its continued relevance in discussions about politics, power, and the potential for corruption in leadership.
