Candide still has a little money and a few jewels, and
					hopes to use what he has to recover Cunégonde. His love and remaining
					fortune momentarily renew his faith in Pangloss’s philosophy. Martin
					the scholar, on the other hand, maintains that God has abandoned
					the world because men kill and maim one another everywhere. En route to
					Bordeaux, Martin and Candide watch a battle between two ships. One
					ship sinks and its crew perishes. Candide finds his sheep in the
					water and realizes that the defeated ship belonged to Vanderdendur.
					Candide claims that there is some good in the world because Vanderdendur
					has met with just punishment, but Martin asks why Vanderdendur’s
					crew had to die with him.

When the coast of France is in sight, Candide asks Martin
					if he has ever been to Paris. Martin says he has, and describes
					his previous encounters with the French and his disgust at what
					he calls their lack of manners. Candide asks Martin why the world
					was made, and Martin replies, “To make us mad.” Candide then asks
					Martin if he believes that men have always done evil things to one
					another. Martin replies with a question, asking Candide if hawks
					have always eaten pigeons. When Candide answers yes, Martin counters
					that if the rest of nature’s beasts do not change, then men do not
					either. Candide disagrees, claiming that men have free will.

The ship arrives in France, and Candide buys a carriage
					so that he and Martin can continue to travel together. They decide
					to visit Paris, but Candide becomes ill upon arriving at their hotel.
					Candide wears a large diamond on his hand that attracts a great
					number of new friends, including two physicians, who force their
					services on him. The physicians only succeed in making Candide sicker.
					Candide and Martin meet an abbé of Perigord and play cards with
					him and his friends. The other players cheat, and Candide loses
					a great deal of money. The abbé takes Candide and Martin to visit
					the Marquise of Parolignac. While there, Candide argues with a philosopher about
					whether everything is for the best in this world. The philosopher
					states that the world is in a state of “unending warfare.” The Marquise
					seduces Candide and steals his jeweled rings.

	By manipulating Candide, the abbé learns that Candide
					has not received a letter from Cunégonde. The next morning, Candide receives
					a letter signed “Cunégonde” with the news that she is ill in Paris
					and wishes him to visit her. Candide and Martin are conducted into
					a dark room. The maidservant explains that Candide may not view
					Cunégonde because light would be harmful to her. Candide gives diamonds
					and gold to the woman he believes to be Cunégonde. The abbé arrives
					with a squad of officers and orders Martin and Candide arrested
					as “suspicious strangers.” Candide bribes an officer with diamonds,
					and the officer lets them go. The officer’s brother, after being
					given more diamonds, puts Candide and Martin on a ship bound for
					England.

When the ship is near shore, Martin and Candide witness
					the execution of an admiral. They learn that England executes admirals
					periodically to encourage the rest of the fleet to fight harder,
					and that this particular admiral was sentenced to death for failing
					to incite his men to get closer to the enemy during a battle with
					the French in Canada. Candide refuses to set foot in England and
					arranges for the captain of the ship to take him to Venice, where
					he is certain he will be reunited with Cunégonde.

—You see, said Candide to Martin, crime
						is punished sometimes; this scoundrel of a Dutch merchant has met the
						fate he deserved. —Yes, said Martin; but did the passengers aboard
						his ship have to perish too?

Martin is a foil to Pangloss. He does not believe that
					everything is for the best in this world, nor does he believe in
					some natural “good.” He acknowledges the evil side of human nature.
					For Martin, the presence of evil in the world does not inspire convoluted
					logical justification. Candide tries to counter Martin’s arguments
					by citing the idea of free will. However, free will does not solve
					the dilemma of the presence of evil in a world created by a perfectly good,
					omniscient, omnipotent Christian God.

	In telling the story of his life, Martin refers to two
					religious ideologies. He claims that the Surinamese clergy persecuted
					him because they thought he was a Socinian. The Socinians were a
					Christian sect formed during the Reformation. They rejected the
					divinity of Christ, the trinity, and original sin. They greatly
					influenced Enlightenment thought and aided in the formation of the
					ideology of the Unitarian Universalist church. The Surinamese clergy
					were, however, mistaken in their understanding of Martin’s “heresy.”
					Martin claims that he is not a Socinian, but a “Manichee.” Manichaeism
					is an ancient religion founded by the sage Mani. The Manichaeans
					see the universe in terms of the dual forces of good and evil. They believe
					that these two forces are equally powerful in the world and are
					continually in conflict. Manichaeans believe that through spiritual
					knowledge, human beings can conquer the evil side of their natures.
					Christians, whose doctrines hinge on a belief in a good and all-powerful
					god who is more powerful than the evil represented by Satan, fiercely
					reject Manichaeism. The precepts of Manichaeism also directly conflict
					with Pangloss’s optimism, since a world dominated in part by evil
					cannot be perfect or perfectible.

For the remainder of the novel, Martin’s ideas provide
					an enlightening counterexample to the beliefs espoused by Pangloss
					and Candide. In general, Martin’s arguments seem more reasonable
					and compelling than Candide’s renditions of Pangloss’s
					ideas. But, like Pangloss, Martin believes so firmly in his own
					view of the world that he occasionally dismisses real evidence that
					contradicts his philosophy, thereby discrediting it. For example,
					in Chapter 24, Martin asserts that Cacambo
					has certainly run off with Candide’s money, and according to Martin’s
					cynical opinion of human nature, there is no way Cacambo could do
					otherwise. In reality, however, Cacambo remains
					loyal to Candide, even though he does not stand to gain anything.
					Like Pangloss’s optimism, Martin’s pessimism is based too heavily
					on abstract speculation and dogmatic belief, and not enough on empirical evidence.
					Voltaire personally may have found ideas like Martin’s philosophy
					more credible, but he does not endorse them entirely in his writing.
					Absolute pessimism, Voltaire seems to say, is as short-sighted and
					self-defeating as absolute optimism.

	In Chapter 22, Voltaire indulges
					in some relatively good-natured satire of his native country. Voltaire
					wrote Candide after he had been in exile for several
					years, and his portrait of the Parisian character, while quite condemnatory,
					has a ring of intimacy to it. He describes the gambling, sexual
					license, theater, and debauchery of the city in colorful detail.
					The xenophobia that the abbé exploits to rob Candide and that forces
					Candide to leave the country is perhaps meant to represent the intellectual
					intolerance that also forced Voltaire out of his homeland.

	Voltaire’s portrayal of the English demonstrates the
					range of his critical eye. He was generally very admiring of English
					government and culture and considered England the most progressive
					nation in Europe. However, Voltaire does not attempt to portray
					England as a perfect, or even a good, place. With his depiction
					of the admiral’s execution, Voltaire acknowledges that even the
					country he most admires subscribes to the same ridiculous, irrational
					logic and the same barbaric practices that are found in every other
					place on earth.
