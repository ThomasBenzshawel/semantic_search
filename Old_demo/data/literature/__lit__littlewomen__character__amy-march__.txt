The youngest March sister, Amy is an artistic beauty who
				is good at manipulating other people. Unlike Jo, Amy acts as a perfect
				lady because it pleases her and those around her. She gets what
				she wants in the end: popularity, the trip to Europe, and Laurie.
				Amy serves as a foil—a character whose attitudes or emotions contrast
				with, and thereby accentuate, those of another character—for Jo,
				who refuses to submit to the conventions of ladyhood. Both artists
				struggle to balance society’s expectations with their own natural
				inclinations. The more genuine of the two and the more generous,
				Jo compares favorably to Amy. Both characters, however, are more
				lovable and real for their flaws.
