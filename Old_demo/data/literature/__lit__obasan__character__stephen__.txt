Stephen is a sensitive and talented boy whose personality
				is warped by the war he lives through. His adulthood is far from
				unsuccessful. To the contrary, he becomes a celebrated musician
				and forms a functional romantic relationship. Professionally and
				personally, his is a more traditionally successful life than Naomi’s.
				But despite this outward flourishing, Stephen is a troubled, unhappy
				man. As a college student, he is embarrassed by and impatient with
				Uncle and Obasan, fleeing from the house when he comes home for
				vacations, refusing Obasan’s food, and generally behaving badly.
				As a grown man, he renounces the Japanese side of his identity almost
				entirely, willfully expunging the language from his memory and exhibiting obvious
				discomfort whenever a food, gesture, or habit of speech strikes
				him as “too Japanese.” He hardly ever comes home, and years pass
				between his visits with Naomi, the one person in the world who best
				understands what his formative years were like. Like Naomi, he survives
				by suppressing memories of his childhood and by becoming, to some
				extent, unknowable. But his suppression and opacity are more dramatic.
				In addition to turning away from his past, he turns away from his
				ethnicity, his family, and his country.
