Tom Jones, published in 1749, is a comic novel by Henry Fielding that follows the lively adventures of the foundling Tom Jones in 18th-century England. Raised by the benevolent Squire Allworthy, Tom's journey involves love, mistaken identity, and a series of humorous escapades. As he navigates the complexities of society and relationships, the novel satirizes social conventions and class distinctions while celebrating the resilience and exuberance of its spirited protagonist in a tale marked by wit, humor, and a keen observation of human nature. Tom Jones has been filmed many times, including a 1963 version that won the Best Picture Academy Award  and a 2023 mini-series on PBS.
