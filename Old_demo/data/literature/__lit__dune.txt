Dune is a science-fiction novel by Frank Herbert that was first published in 1965. ItÂ is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes around cultural and historical development, religion, ecology, and human nature. But at its core, the novel is a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and the corrupting influence of power. Through the character of Paul Atreides, Herbert demonstrates how an individual's desire for power, even if originally unintended, can lead to disastrously chaotic consequences for themselves and the world around them.
