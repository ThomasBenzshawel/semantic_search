Malcolm and Tagoe are Rufus’s foster brothers and best friends who function together to embody the values of love and loyalty. Together, the boys and their former foster sister, Aimee, call themselves the Plutos, and their devotion to each other represents the importance of found family. Malcolm, who lost his parents in a fire, is devoted to his fellow Plutos. It’s Malcolm who comes up with the idea of getting arrested so Rufus can escape facing charges for assaulting Peck, a sacrifice that enables Rufus to spend his End Day with Mateo and find love. Malcolm is also a paradoxical character who serves as a reminder not to judge people by appearances and stereotypes. He’s a huge, muscular Black teenager who is stereotyped as being intimidating and frightening, but he is a sensitive soul and a loyal friend who’s never been in a fight. Similarly, Tagoe suffers from a tic that makes him seem erratic and unapproachable, but he is generally good at centering himself and is a loyal friend. Tagoe reveals he is willing to sacrifice himself to protect the ones he loves when he gets arrested, risking his future as a college student so that Rufus can escape and have a chance at a fulfilling End Day. While in jail, his revelation that he’d rather spend his End Day with loved ones than by getting revenge against the parents who abandoned him, proves that he understands the value of prioritizing the healthy and supportive relationships in his life.
