Though only twenty-two, Holgrave is the product of passion,
				hard work, and travel. He is a man of great integrity, as we learn
				when he does not take advantage of the hypnotized Phoebe and when
				he supports and comforts the despondent Hepzibah. Although Hepzibah views
				Holgrave’s friends as disreputable, the young man’s politics come
				across as boldly exciting, rich with vitality and possibility. Holgrave
				is not without a dark side and foibles, and the familiar Maule bitterness
				toward the Pyncheon family infects him as well. This sense of bitterness
				and rancor shows how Holgrave continues the Maule legacy of revenge
				and faulty judgment. His politics, once so inspiring, end up seeming
				rather flimsy; they crumble almost overnight once he has won Phoebe’s
				love and seen the Judge dead. Moreover, he has a tendency to underestimate
				others, brashly assuming that he can read Phoebe like a book. Overall,
				though, Holgrave emerges as a sympathetic figure, and his decision
				not to abuse his family powers of hypnosis helps to diminish some
				of the family stigma he bears.
