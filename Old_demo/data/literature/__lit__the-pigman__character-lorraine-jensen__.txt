Along with John Conlan, with whom she alternates narration, Lorraine is the protagonist of the story. A high school sophomore, Lorraine moved to the neighborhood the previous year, and John is her only true friend. When the novel opens, Lorraine seems to be more centered and serious than John. She understands the strengths she possesses, like compassion. This ability to understand herself and others comes from her innate sensitivity and her interest in psychology. Lorraine also wants to be a writer, so she pays a careful attention to what people say and do.

Lorraine has her faults, however, spinning lies easily and too often not speaking up for what she knows is right, particularly regarding John’s behavior around Mr. Pignati. She also sees “omens” in certain negative occurrences. Only in hindsight does she identify these events as indications that they shouldn’t have been in a relationship with the Pigman. This habit provides a means for Lorraine to escape responsibility for her own actions or lack of actions.

Lorraine has been deeply marked by life without parental figures. Her father had an affair and left their family before he died, and her emotionally unsupportive mother completely misunderstands Lorraine. Because of this, Lorraine’s friendship with John is invaluable, and she sometimes feels forced to be the person that he expects her to be instead of the person she wants to be. Lorraine also has a crush on John but doesn’t reveal it, though she does provide hints early in the narrative. She calls the time when she and John dress up in the Pignatis’ clothes “the first time I was glad to be alive.”

Lorraine truly appreciates the time spent with Mr. Pignati, both in and outside his house. He makes her feel appreciated and special, and she tries not to take advantage of his generosity. Through their friendship, Lorraine at last has the family she always wanted.
