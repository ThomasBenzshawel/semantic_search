Rinaldi’s character serves an important function in A
					Farewell to Arms. He dominates an array of minor male characters
				who embody the kind of virile, competent, and good-natured masculinity
				that, for better or worse, so much of Hemingway’s fiction celebrates.
				Rinaldi is an unbelievable womanizer, professing to be in love with
				Catherine at the beginning of the novel but claiming soon thereafter
				to be relieved that he is not, like Henry, saddled with the complicated
				emotional baggage that the love of a woman entails. Considering
				Rinaldi’s frequent visits to the local whorehouses, Henry later
				muses that his friend has most likely succumbed to syphilis. While
				this registers as an unpleasant end, it is presented with an air
				of detached likelihood rather than fervent moralizing. It is, in
				other words, not punishment for a man’s bad behavior but rather
				the consequence of a man behaving as a man—living large, living
				boldly, and being true to himself.
