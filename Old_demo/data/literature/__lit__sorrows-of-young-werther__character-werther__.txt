Werther, the protagonist, is as notable for the qualities that he does not possess as he is for those that he does. He is well-educated and intelligent, but his emotions cloud his capacity for rational thought. He is of upper-middle class but not noble, and wealthy enough to not feel pressed about his career but not wealthy enough to completely abandon some career aspirations. His moods range from suicidal depression and grumpiness to feelings of euphoria in the midst of romantic love, the outdoors, literature, symbolism, art, and intellectual discourse. He has a tendency to idealize those of the working class and vilify those of the upper class, all without making sweeping judgments about his own social class.

Werther lacks the maturity to take good care of himself emotionally, and whenever he has a chance to put himself in a psychologically disastrous situation, he jumps in with both feet. In temperament, Werther and his likable rival Albert are opposites, but they like and respect one another nonetheless. However, as Werther grows more and more obsessed with Charlotte, he consequently likes and respects Albert far less, because ultimately Werther’s only concern is his obsession with Charlotte, even at the expense of his own well-being. The long-term effects of hopeless love, anguish, anger, and suicidal depression ultimately extinguish the many good qualities that Werther once possessed.
