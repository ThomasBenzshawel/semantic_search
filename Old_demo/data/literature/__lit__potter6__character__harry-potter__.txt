Harry is accurately dubbed the “Chosen One” by the Daily Prophet,
				as it is Harry Potter’s unfortunate responsibility to destroy the
				evil Lord Voldemort, according to a prophecy made by Professor Trelawney
				and brought to Lord Voldemort by Severus Snape. Although Harry has
				never shied away from his destiny, bravely and repeatedly attempting
				to thwart Voldemort, he is nonetheless frustrated by his inability
				to have a normal school life. Harry is not a perfect wizard and
				certainly not the strongest student at Hogwarts. Often, Hermione
				has to help both Ron and Harry with their class assignments, and
				neither casts perfect spells. Instead, Harry’s strength lies in
				his conviction, his loyalty, and his ability to ask for help. In Harry
					Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, readers see Harry slowly
				maturing into a young man, as evidenced by his romantic relationship
				with Ginny Weasley and his increasingly loyal connection to Dumbledore.

As strong as Harry may be, he still suffers greatly from
				the unspeakable horrors of his past. Both of his parents were murdered by
				Voldemort, and those closest to him often feel the fire of his birthright.
				Consequently, Harry is frightened by the thought of becoming close
				to anyone or anything else. His loving parents James and Lily, his
				godfather Sirius Black, and his hero Dumbledore have all died while
				trying to protect him. Ultimately, Harry realizes he must sacrifice
				his newfound love for Ginny Weasley to prevent her from ending up
				like his other loves.
