Donna Tartt's first novel, The Secret History, contains elements of mystery and of the psychological fiction genre. It was published in 1992. The novel’s action takes place around the elite liberal arts campus of fictional Hampden College in Vermont, a the setting that mirrors Tartt’s experience in the 1980s at Bennington College, where she started writing The Secret History as a student. Set over a school year, the story follows a tightly knit group of six students studying ancient Greek who revel in the beauty of the ancient world but become tied together by a dark secret.
