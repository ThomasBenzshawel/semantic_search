As David was born and raised in the Smoke, has never been exposed to civilization. His parents, Maddy and Az, were the original “runaways” who left the city to found the Smoke to investigate the effects of the brain lesions they discovered were rampant among people who received cosmetic surgery. David was trained by his parents to protect the Smoke and carefully guard its secrets. Even though David has grown up in the “wild,” he has an air of sophistication, integrity, and grace that exceeds the Pretties. When Tally asks him if he thinks she is prettier than Shay he hesitates to answer, trying to remain diplomatic. 

When David senses Tally’s hesitation about being in the Smoke, and what he feels is her anxiety about living in the wild for the first time, he feels a sense of duty to tell Tally the truth about the operations so she can make an informed decision before abandoning the Smoke and heading back to the city. When Tally tries to recruit the Uglies Sussy, Dex, and An to help them deflect Special Circumstances by telling them it’s a prerequisite of their admission into the Smoke, David quickly corrects her and says they just need their help. Furthermore, David is attracted to Shay’s bravery and serious character, more than her physical features. At first, Tally is put off by David’s slow manner and handmade clothes, but it’s his love and admiration for her that allows Tally to see that beauty is both an internal and external feature. Through David’s care and example, Tally is allowed to grow emotionally and see past her society’s conditioning.
