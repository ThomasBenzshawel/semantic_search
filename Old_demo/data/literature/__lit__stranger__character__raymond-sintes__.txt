Raymond acts as a catalyst to The Stranger’s
				plot. After Raymond beats and abuses his mistress, he comes into
				conflict with her brother, an Arab. Raymond draws Meursault into
				conflict with “the Arab,” and eventually Meursault kills the Arab
				in cold blood. By drawing Meursault into the conflict that eventually
				results in Meursault’s death sentence, Raymond, in a sense, causes
				Meursault’s downfall. This responsibility on Raymond’s part is symbolized
				by the fact that he gives Meursault the gun that Meursault later
				uses to kill the Arab. However, because the murder and subsequent
				trial bring about Meursault’s realization of the indifference of
				the universe, Raymond can also be seen as a catalyst of Meursault’s “enlightenment.”

	Because Raymond’s character traits contrast greatly with
				Meursault’s, he also functions as a foil for Meursault. Whereas
				Meursault is simply amoral, Raymond is clearly immoral. Raymond’s
				treatment of his mistress is violent and cruel, and he nearly kills
				the Arab himself before Meursault talks him out of it. Additionally,
				whereas Meursault passively reacts to the events around him, Raymond
				initiates action. He invites Meursault to dinner and to the beach,
				and he seeks out the Arabs after his first fight with them.

	A good deal of ambiguity exists in Raymond’s relationship
				with Meursault. On the one hand, Raymond uses Meursault. He easily convinces
				Meursault to help him in his schemes to punish his mistress, and
				to testify on his behalf at the police station. On the other hand,
				Raymond seems to feel some loyalty toward Meursault. He asserts
				Meursault’s innocence at the murder trial, attributing the events
				leading up to the killing to “chance.” It is possible that Raymond
				begins his relationship with Meursault intending only to use him,
				and then, like Marie, becomes drawn to Meursault’s peculiarities.
