Terrified that his fellow soldiers will revile him for
					fleeing from the battle, Henry totters toward the fire. He navigates
					his way past the bodies of his sleeping comrades with great difficulty.
					Suddenly a loud voice instructs him to halt. Henry recognizes Wilson
					standing guard. He informs Wilson that he has been shot in the head
					after being separated from the regiment and fighting with another
					group. His friend immediately turns him over to the corporal. The
					corporal examines him and decides that Henry has been grazed by
					a shell, which has left little more than a lump: “jest as if some
					feller had lammed yeh on th’ head with a club.” Wearily, Henry watches
					the camp until Wilson returns with a canteen of coffee. He nurses Henry,
					tending to his head with a wet cloth and giving him his blanket
					for the night. Grateful and dazed, Henry drifts off to sleep.

Henry wakes in the gray, misty dawn, feeling as though
					he has been “asleep for a thousand years.” In the distance he hears
					the roar of fighting which rumbles around him with a “deadly persistency.” Looking
					around at his sleeping comrades, Henry believes for a moment that
					he is surrounded by dead men and cries out in anguish. When the
					bugle blows, however, the men get up slowly. Wilson asks Henry how
					he feels as he tends to his head. “Pretty bad,” Henry replies. As
					Wilson tends to Henry, Henry notices a change in his friend: he
					is no longer the loud soldier, that sensitive and prickly youth
					obsessed with his own sense of valor. Instead, he seems to have
					acquired a quiet, but remarkable, confidence. The two men discuss
					the battle, and Henry reports that Jim Conklin is dead. A group
					of soldiers exchanges harsh words near Henry and Wilson, nearly
					coming to blows. Wilson intervenes, keeps the peace, and returns
					to Henry. He says that the regiment lost more than half of its men
					the day before, but that many of them have since returned—they scattered
					in the woods, he reports, and fought with other regiments, just
					like Henry.

He had performed his mistakes in the
						dark, so he was still a man.

Henry remembers the yellow envelope that Wilson had asked
					to be delivered to his family upon his death. He is about to remind
					Wilson of it, but thinks better of this at the last moment. He believes
					that having the envelope—an emblem of Wilson’s past vulnerability—will
					enable him to deflect any unpleasant questions Wilson might ask
					about Henry’s activities during the previous day. For Henry, the envelope
					becomes an insurance policy against being caught in a lie, and his
					self-assurance is restored. He does not worry about the battles
					ahead of him, thinking that he is “doomed to greatness” and cannot
					be killed. He feels scorn for his comrades who ran from the battle
					the previous day, thinking that they fled more wildly than was necessary,
					while he himself “fled with discretion and dignity.”

Wilson interrupts Henry’s reverie by asking him for the
					envelope back. Henry returns it, and Wilson seems deeply embarrassed. Henry
					feels sorry for his friend and immensely superior to him; he imagines
					telling his mother and a young lady from his hometown stories of
					the war, and thinks that his tales will shatter their feeble preconceptions
					of heroism and combat.

In preparing Henry for his next experience in battle,
					these three chapters focus almost entirely on his vanity, hypocrisy,
					and unfounded sense of superiority, which escalate by Chapter XV
					to an almost unbearable degree. As the narrative progresses, Henry allows
					the opinions of his peers to determine not only his sense of moral
					behavior, but also his very sense of truth. He feels no guilt upon
					discovering that his shameful injury can pass as a respect-inspiring,
					combat-inflicted wound. Furthermore, even though he ran while Wilson
					fought, Henry feels superior to his friend when he remembers the
					yellow envelope, which he considers concrete proof of Wilson’s cowardice.
					Without such proof to mark his own downfall, and with the validation
					of his wound as a testament to his alleged courage, Henry feels
					invincible: “He had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was
					still a man.” Though his main experience of war so far has been
					running from it, Henry demonstrates his stomach-turning vanity by
					imagining that he will soon regale the women in his life with his
					shocking and moving stories of battle.

Through such developments, Crane explores Henry’s
					nearly limitless powers of self-delusion. In his desperate need
					to rebuild his shattered sense of importance, Henry blocks the coming
					battle out of his mind, content instead to rest upon his unearned
					laurels. Though he has yet to prove himself, Henry believes that
					he is destined to do great deeds. He is certain that fate, God,
					or the universe—the utter indifference of which has so recently
					shocked him—will keep him alive and thriving. Crane uses these passages to
					reveal the complex subtleties of man’s instinctual impulse to survive,
					linking it to less excusable behaviors induced by self-deception
					and vanity.

Throughout The Red Badge of Courage, vanity
					and self-deception prove to be the mind’s most successful strategy
					for coping with the extraordinary fragility and insignificance of
					human life. If not for self-delusion, the dangers one faces would
					drive one mad; if not for vanity, one’s own unimportance would drive
					one to despair. Part of the instinct to survive hinges on the individual’s
					belief in the importance of his own survival, the preciousness of
					his life. As a result of fleeing the dangers of war and the despair
					that follows them, Henry has come face to face with his own insignificance,
					and reacts in the only way available to him. To maintain control
					over his fears, he lies to those around him and then convinces himself
					that whatever they believe—that he is courageous, for example—is
					true.

In this section, Henry’s hypocrisy contrasts sharply with
					Wilson’s sense of security in himself. Having faced battle rather
					than running from it, Wilson has gained perspective on his own modest
					place in the universe without shattering his ego. He does not allow
					his pride to prevent him from asking Henry for the yellow envelope
					back, though doing so causes him considerable embarrassment. His
					newfound maturity enables him to temper his earlier propensities
					for arrogant battle-lust and sniveling self-pity.
