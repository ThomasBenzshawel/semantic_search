George and Bertha Dorset are an extremely wealthy couple
trapped in a loveless marriage. Bertha is an obnoxious, manipulative
socialite who uses gossip and wealth to get what she wants, including
the attention of other men. Initially, Bertha pursues Selden, and
later she uses Lily as a distraction for George so she can have
an affair with another young bachelor. Bertha then becomes jealous
of George’s affection for Lily and spreads rumors that result in
Lily’s expulsion from society. In the meantime, George is dragged
along through his wife’s escapades, eventually looking for divorce
and Lily’s hand in marriage.
