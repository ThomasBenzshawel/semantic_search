Vernon Harvey is the stepfather of Faith Hathaway, the
				teenage girl who was raped and murdered by Robert Willie and Joe
				Vaccaro. Before she introduces Vernon in the book, Prejean recounts
				the interviews he has granted saying he cannot wait to see Robert
				Willie executed for his crime. Vernon’s rage and grief have made
				him a vocal supporter of the death penalty, but he is also a compassionate and
				considerate man. From the first moment he encounters Prejean, he
				is willing to listen to her side of the debate, regardless of how much
				he disagrees with her. His position on capital punishment is unshakeable,
				but he respects the right of others to fight for what they believe
				in. After Faith’s murder, Vernon relies on anger to help him move
				beyond his grief. Every time he speaks of his stepdaughter’s murder,
				he is overcome with emotions that have not been healed by time or
				by Robert Willie’s execution.
