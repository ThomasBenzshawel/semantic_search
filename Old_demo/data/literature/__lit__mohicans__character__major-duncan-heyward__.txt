Heyward plays a well-meaning but slightly foolish white
				man, the conventional counterpart to the ingenious, diverse Hawkeye.
				While Hawkeye moves effortlessly throughout the wild frontier, Heyward never
				feels secure. He wants to maintain the swagger and confidence he
				likely felt in all-white England, but the unfamiliar and unpredictable
				landscape does him in. Some of Heyward’s difficulties stem from
				his inability to understand the Indians. Still, despite Heyward’s failings,
				Cooper does not satirize Heyward or make him into a buffoon. Heyward
				does demonstrate constant integrity and a well-meaning nature, both
				of which mitigate his lack of social understanding. Cooper also
				treats Heyward gently because Heyward plays the most typical romantic
				hero in the novel, and so he must appear strong and handsome, not
				ridiculous and inept. Heyward and Alice, although presented as a
				bland couple, make up the swooning, cooing pair necessary to a sentimental
				novel.
