Go Set a Watchman is the second novel by Harper Lee, published posthumously in 2015. It is set in the mid-1950s and features many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird twenty years after the events in the earlier novel. Scout has returned to Maycomb from New York to visit her father, Atticus. She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father’s attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood.
