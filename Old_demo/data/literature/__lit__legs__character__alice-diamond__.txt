Jack's wife, Alice, is a homemaker. She has furnished their home; she cooks Jack's meals and takes care of his dogs. She surrounds Jack with religion. In general, Alice takes care of her husband. Jack says that Kiki wouldn't be able to take care of a dog, that she would let it die. To Jack, Kiki is the party- girl-sex-object with a small brain and big breasts.

Alice likes the idea of turning Jack into a traveling evangelist-showman. Jack's occupation bothers her, but she likes his notoriety; were he to become a showman, he could carry with him all of the notorious legend that appeals to Alice, but without the murdering and drug smuggling. If he were to preach about having a religious turnaround, Jack could admit to all of the past wrongdoings that make him infamous. The idea particularly appeals to Alice, because it would mean Jack was taking on a holy role, and Alice could finally feel she was married to a devout Catholic.

After Jack dies, Alice creates her own show about how crime doesn't pay, which is essentially a rehashed version of the show Jack could have taken on the road himself. In a sense, Alice is trying to atone for her husband's crimes. Still, Alice never leads a saint's life, even after Jack's death. Marcus suggests that Alice maintained a few of her husband's underworld connections. She also gets union kickbacks, likely because she threatened the unions. Alice met a violent end.
