Sonya is quiet, timid, and easily embarrassed, but she
				is also extremely devout and devoted to her family. Her sacrifice
				of prostituting herself for the sake of her family is made even
				more poignant by the fact that it would not be necessary were her
				father able to control his drinking habit. Initially scared of the
				half-delirious Raskolnikov, Sonya, in her infinite capacity for
				understanding, begins to care deeply about him. She is not horrified
				by his crimes, but rather, concerned for his soul and mental well-being,
				urges him to confess. Raskolnikov thinks of her, at first, as a
				fellow transgressor, someone who has stepped over the line between
				morality and immorality, just as he has. But there is a crucial
				difference between their transgressions that Raskolnikov is unwilling
				to acknowledge: she sins for the sake of others, whereas he sins
				for no one but himself. Sonya illustrates important social and political
				issues that were of concern to Dostoevsky, such as the treatment
				of women, the effects of poverty, the importance of religious faith,
				and the importance of devotion to family.
