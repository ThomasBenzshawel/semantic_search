Unferth’s challenge to Beowulf’s honor differentiates
				him from Beowulf and helps to reveal some of the subtleties of the
				heroic code that the warriors must follow. Unferth is presented
				as a lesser man, a foil for the near-perfect Beowulf. (A foil is
				a character whose traits contrast with and thereby accentuate those
				of another character.) The bitterness of Unferth’s chiding of Beowulf
				about his swimming match with Breca clearly reflects his jealousy
				of the attention that Beowulf receives. It probably also stems from
				his shame at being unable to protect Heorot himself—he is clearly
				not the sort of great warrior whom legend will remember. While boasting
				is a proper and acceptable form of self-assertion, Unferth’s harsh
				words show that it ought not to be bitter or disparaging of others.
				Rather than heroism, Unferth’s blustering reveals pride and resentment.
				Later, Unferth’s gift of his sword for Beowulf’s fight against Grendel’s mother
				heals Unferth’s breach of hospitality, but it does little to improve
				his heroic status. Unlike Beowulf, Unferth is clearly afraid to
				fight the monster himself.
