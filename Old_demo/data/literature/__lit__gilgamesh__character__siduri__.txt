Siduri is the tavern keeper who at first bars her door
				to Gilgamesh and then shares her sensuous, worldly wisdom with him,
				advising him to cherish the pleasures of this world. Though
				she tries to dissuade him from his quest, she tells him how to find
				Urshanabi the boatman, without whose help he’d surely fail. The
				goddess of wine-making and brewing, Siduri is only one of several
				sexually ripe, nurturing women who appear in this most explicitly
				homoerotic tale. The male characters may take these females for
				granted, but they nevertheless play an essential role. The temple
				prostitute Shamhat domesticates Enkidu. Utnapishtim’s unnamed wife
				softens her husband toward Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh’s mother Ninsun
				adopts Enkidu as her son, not only endorsing his friendship to Gilgamesh
				but also making him Gilgamesh’s brother. Ishtar herself, fickle
				and dangerously mercurial as she is as the goddess of war and love,
				nevertheless weeps bitterly to see how the deluge that she had helped
				to bring about ravaged her human children. As loudly as it celebrates
				male bonding and the masculine virtues of physical prowess, The
					Epic of Gilgamesh doesn’t forget to pay its respects to feminine
				qualities.
