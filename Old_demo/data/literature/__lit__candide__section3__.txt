The old woman tells her story. It turns out that she is
					the daughter of Pope Urban X and the princess of Palestrina. She
					was raised in the midst of incredible wealth. At fourteen, already
					a stunning beauty, she was engaged to the prince of Massa Carrara.
					The two of them loved each another passionately. However, during
					the lavish wedding celebration, the prince’s mistress killed the
					prince with a poisoned drink, and the old woman and her mother set
					sail to mourn at their estate in Gaeta. On the way, pirates boarded
					the ship and the pope’s soldiers surrendered without a fight. The
					pirates examined every bodily orifice of their prisoners, searching
					for hidden jewels. They raped the women and sailed to Morocco to
					sell them as slaves.

	A civil war was underway in Morocco, and the pirates
					were attacked. The old woman saw her mother and their maids of honor ripped
					apart by the men fighting over them. After the fray ended, the old
					woman climbed out from under a heap of dead bodies and crawled to
					rest under a tree. She awoke to find an Italian eunuch vainly attempting
					to rape her.

A hundred times I wanted to kill myself,
						but always I loved life more.	

The old woman continues her story. Despite the eunuch’s
					attempt to rape her, she was delighted to encounter a countryman,
					and the eunuch carried her to a nearby cottage to care for her.
					They discovered that he had once served in her mother’s palace.
					The eunuch promised to take the old woman back to Italy, but then
					took her to Algiers and sold her to the prince as a concubine.

The plague swept through Algiers, killing the prince and
					the eunuch. The old woman was subsequently sold several times and ended
					up in the hands of a Muslim military commander. He took his seraglio
					with him when ordered to defend the city of Azov against the Russians.
					The Russians leveled the city, and only the commander’s fort was
					left standing. Desperate for food, the officers killed and ate two
					eunuchs. They planned to do the same with the women, but a “pious
					and sympathetic” religious leader persuaded them to merely cut one
					buttock from each woman for food. Eventually, the Russians killed
					all the officers.

	The women were taken to Moscow. A nobleman took the old woman
					as his slave and beat her daily for two years. He was executed for
					“court intrigue,” and the old woman escaped. She worked as a servant
					in inns across Russia. She came close to suicide many times in her
					life, but never carried it out because she “loved life” too much.
					The old woman wonders why human nature makes people want to live
					even though life itself is so often a curse. She tells Candide and
					Cunégonde to ask each passenger on the ship to tell his story. She
					wagers that every single one has been upset to be alive.

At the old woman’s urging, Candide and Cunégonde ask their
					fellow passengers about their experiences. They find that the old woman’s
					prediction is correct. When the ship docks at Buenos Aires, they
					visit the haughty, self-important governor, Don Fernando d’Ibaraa
					y Figueora y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza, who orders Candide
					to review his company. When Candide leaves, Don Fernando begs Cunégonde
					to marry him. The shrewd old woman advises Cunégonde to marry the
					governor, as marrying him could make both her and Candide’s fortune.

	Meanwhile, a Portuguese official and police arrive in
					the city. It turns out that when the Franciscan who stole Cunégonde’s
					jewels tried to sell them, the jeweler recognized them as belonging
					to the Grand Inquisitor. Before he was hanged, the Franciscan described the
					three people from whom he stole the jewels—ostensibly the Grand
					Inquisitor’s murderers. The authorities sent the Portuguese official
					to capture these three. The old woman advises Cunégonde to remain
					in Buenos Aires, since Candide was responsible for the murder and
					the governor will not allow the authorities to do Cunégonde any
					harm. The old woman advises Candide to flee immediately.

The old woman’s story serves a dual purpose. The catalogue
					of her sufferings illustrates a vast array of human evils that contradict
					Pangloss’s optimistic view of the world. She has lived through violence, rape,
					slavery, and betrayal and seen the ravages of war and greed.

	The old woman’s story also functions as a criticism of
					religious hypocrisy. She is the daughter of the Pope, the most prominent member
					of the Catholic Church. The Pope has not only violated his vow of
					celibacy, but has also proven unable and unwilling to protect his
					daughter from the misfortunes that befell her.

	The officers who eat the old woman’s buttock value the
					integrity of their military oath more highly than the lives of the
					eunuchs and women inside their fort. Their behavior demonstrates
					the folly of absurd adherence to an outmoded system of belief. Even
					after it is clear that their side has no hope of winning the war,
					the officers choose to practice cannibalism rather than betray their
					oath. This choice undermines their lofty concepts of honor and duty,
					and makes even the cleric, who advocates mutilation rather than
					execution, appear humane.

	Figures such as the cleric, who perform “good” deeds
					that are somehow compromised, limited, or otherwise ineffective,
					turn up throughout the novel and are often presented comically or
					ironically. Another example is the kindly French surgeon who treats
					the women’s wounds but does nothing to prevent them from being sold to
					new slave owners. The surgeon’s “enlightened” practice of medicine
					does nothing to alleviate the women’s real suffering. He merely helps
					the women survive to encounter more misery and injustice.

	The old woman is pessimistic but acutely aware of the
					world she lives in. Direct experience dictates her worldview, and
					her pragmatism lends her more wisdom and credibility than any of
					her travel companions. The old woman chides Cunégonde for making
					judgments about the world based on her limited experience, and urges Candide
					and Cunégonde to gather knowledge through investigation before making
					judgments. Through her character, Voltaire reiterates the importance
					of actual, verifiable evidence and the limited value of judgments
					based on empty philosophical rhetoric.

	The old woman defines life as misery, but unlike her
					younger companions she is not prone to self-pity. She tells Cunégonde,
					“I would not even have mentioned my own misfortunes, if you had
					not irked me a bit, and if it weren’t the custom, on shipboard,
					to pass the time with stories.” For her, tales of woe are neither
					edifying nor moving. They are simply a way of making a point and
					staving off boredom. Though her suffering does not move her to self-pity,
					it does shape the pragmatism and frankness that define her character.

	The old woman’s meditations on suicide speak to one of
					the novel’s most pressing underlying concerns. If life is so full
					of unmitigated suffering, the prospect of taking one’s own life
					seems a reasonable option. The old woman, a Pope’s daughter, does
					not even consider the standard Christian mandate that suicide is
					a sin and that those who commit it are destined to burn in hell.
					Despite her pessimism, the old woman’s speech on this subject has
					a strange hopefulness to it. She asserts that people cling to life
					because they love it, not because they fear eternal punishment.
					Human beings naturally embrace life—a stupid move, perhaps, but
					one that demonstrates passion, strong will, and an almost heroic
					endurance.

	Don Fernando represents a satire on the arrogance of
					the nobility. His long list of names mocks the importance that the
					nobility attaches to titles. Here, Voltaire once again attacks the
					nobility’s belief that it is naturally endowed with superior virtues
					that entitle it to wealth and power. Rather than being a wise or
					just governor, Don Fernando is a predator, a liar, a cheat, and
					a joke.

	Cunégonde’s decision to accept Don Fernando’s proposal
					adds greater complexity to her character. She is the object of Candide’s lust
					and idealistic devotion, and Voltaire repeatedly refers to her as “the
					lovely Cunégonde.” But she is far from the semi-divine romantic
					heroine Candide believes her to be, and her calculating, self-serving
					decision to marry the Don is proof of this. Voltaire undercuts Candide’s
					romantic ideals by having him continue to worship Cunégonde even
					after she faithlessly marries the Don. It is possible that Voltaire
					also uses these ideals to emphasize Cunégonde’s lack of chastity,
					although it is unlikely that Voltaire means to condemn her for this.
					Cunégonde uses her beauty and sexuality to manipulate men, which
					seems a highly reasonable way of behaving in a world in which sexuality
					is the only asset women possess.
