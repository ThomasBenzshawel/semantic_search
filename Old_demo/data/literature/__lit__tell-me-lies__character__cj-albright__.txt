CJ, Lucy’s mother, is a strong-minded woman who loves her family unconditionally. Throughout most of the book, CJ’s character, actions, and motives are vilified, as presented through the lens of Lucy’s anger at CJ’s affair with Gabe. Lucy interprets CJ’s efforts to convince her to go to college closer to home as attempts to control her, and she sees the myriad ways CJ reaches out to mend their relationship as pathetic attempts to be a “cool mom.” However, other characters do see CJ in a positive light. When Jackie first meets Lucy at Baird, she sees CJ give Lucy earrings and a bottle of vodka with the advice to contact her if she wants to experiment. Lucy scoffs at CJ, but inwardly acknowledges that Jackie, like many, probably thinks CJ is a good mom. Despite Lucy’s painful rejections, CJ shows her unconditional love when she insists on getting Lucy psychiatric care, arrives to take care of her after her breakup with Stephen, and forgives her for stealing Marilyn’s jewelry. When Lucy finally confronts CJ about her affair with Gabe, CJ’s true nature is revealed: she is a remorseful, loving wife committed to repairing her betrayal to her husband, just as she has always been a devoted mother intent on healing her relationship with Lucy.
