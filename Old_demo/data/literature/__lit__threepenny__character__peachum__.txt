Peachum is Macheath’s antagonist, the character who opposes
				the hero and sets the plot in motion. Self-interest motivates Peachum throughout The
					Threepenny Opera. His only concern is making a profit with
				his business. Throughout the play, Peachum does not change. He never
				sways from trying to keep what is his. However, when the queen frees
				Macheath at the end of the play, Peachum gives up and accepts defeat.
				This moment of defeat is the only instance in which Peachum experiences
				a change within himself.

Peachum is an ironic villain. Traditionally, the villain
				would pursue evil essentially for the sake of evil. He would be
				someone who does horrible things because he is innately bad. This
				kind of villain actually reinforces traditional moral positions
				by making the audience see how awful a person is without them. Peachum,
				however, is the play’s strongest advocate of traditional morality.
				He obeys the law, reads the Bible, and wants his daughter to respect
				her parents. Yet he reads the Bible and obeys the law only because
				he thinks these activities will aide his business, not because he
				desires to be a noble citizen. Peachum’s use of traditional morality
				to justify his cruelty is a powerful way to emphasize both the arbitrariness
				of values and hypocrisy of religion.
