Javert is so obsessed with enforcing society’s laws and
				morals that he does not realize he is living by mistaken assumptions—a tragic and ironic flaw in a man who believes so strongly in enforcing
				what he believes is right. Although Javert is such a stern and inflexible character
				that it is hard to sympathize with him, he lives with the shame
				of knowing that his own Gypsy upbringing is not so different from
				the backgrounds of the men he pursues. He lives his life trying to
				erase this shame through his strict commitment to upholding the law.

Javert’s flaw, however, is that he never stops to question
				whether the laws themselves are just. In his mind, a man is guilty
				when the law declares him so. When Valjean finally gives Javert
				irrefutable proof that a man is not necessarily evil just because
				the law says he is, Javert is incapable of reconciling this new
				knowledge with his beliefs. He commits suicide, plagued by the thought
				that he may be living a dishonorable life. True to Javert’s nature,
				he makes this decision not with any emotional hysterics, but rather
				with a cool determination. Although he is a man of logic, he is
				impassioned about his work. To this end, Hugo frequently uses animal
				imagery to describe Javert, particularly when he likens him to a
				tiger. In the end, it is difficult to feel anything other than pity
				for Javert, who assumes his duty with such savagery that he seems
				more animal than man.
