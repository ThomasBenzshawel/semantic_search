Rodman Philbrook’s 1993 young adult novel Freak the Mighty tells the story of two teenage boys—one who is developmentally disabled and the other who is physically disabled—who form an unlikely friendship. Set in New Hampshire, the book explores the importance of storytelling as well as how friends can bring out the best version of each other. The novel was the basis for the 1998 film The Mighty starring Kieran Culkin, Elden Hensen, and Sharon Stone. Also in 1998, Philbrook published a sequel called Max the Mighty.
