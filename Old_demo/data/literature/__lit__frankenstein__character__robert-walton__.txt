Walton’s letters to his sister form a frame around the
main narrative, Victor Frankenstein’s tragic story. Walton captains
a North Pole–bound ship that gets trapped between sheets of ice.
While waiting for the ice to thaw, he and his crew pick up Victor,
weak and emaciated from his long chase after the monster. Victor
recovers somewhat, tells Walton the story of his life, and then
dies. Walton laments the death of a man with whom he felt a strong,
meaningful friendship beginning to form.

Walton functions as the conduit through which the reader
hears the story of Victor and his monster. However, he also plays
a role that parallels Victor’s in many ways. Like Victor, Walton
is an explorer, chasing after that “country of eternal light”—unpossessed knowledge.
Victor’s influence on him is paradoxical: one moment he exhorts
Walton’s almost-mutinous men to stay the path courageously, regardless
of danger; the next, he serves as an abject example of the dangers
of heedless scientific ambition. In his ultimate decision to terminate
his treacherous pursuit, Walton serves as a foil (someone whose
traits or actions contrast with, and thereby highlight, those of
another character) to Victor, either not obsessive enough to risk
almost-certain death or not courageous enough to allow his passion
to drive him.
