Mustapha Mond is the most powerful and intelligent proponent
of the World State. Early in the novel, it is his voice that explains
the history of the World State and the philosophy upon which it
is based. Later in the novel it is his debate with John that lays
out the fundamental difference in values between World State society
and the kind of society represented in Shakespeare’s plays.

Mustapha Mond is a paradoxical figure. He reads
Shakespeare and the Bible and he used to be an independent-minded
scientist, but he also censors new ideas and controls a totalitarian
state. For Mond, humankind’s ultimate goals are stability and happiness,
as opposed to emotions, human relations, and individual expression.
By combining a firm commitment to the values of the World State
with a nuanced understanding of its history and function, Mustapha
Mond presents a formidable opponent for John, Bernard, and Helmholtz.
