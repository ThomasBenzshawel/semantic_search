Christian represents the other half of the romantic hero.
				He operates as Cyrano’s spokesman and comes to represent the shallowness of
				outer beauty. His good looks and charm tend to overshadow his lingering
				shyness, waning creativity, and eloquence. Christian’s needs and
				desires are simple and clear compared to Cyrano’s more complex motivations
				and goals. Yet there is an undeniable, human source to Christian’s
				deeper emotions and feelings. He is a legitimate lover, but he has
				no talents to express his love. Christian proves to be rather average
				in all but his striking physical attractiveness.
