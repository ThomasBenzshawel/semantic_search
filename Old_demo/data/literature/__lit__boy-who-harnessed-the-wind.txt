The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope is the 2009 autobiography of William Kamkwamba written with Bryan Mealer. For William, growing up in Malawi posed unique challenges but also fueled his innovative spirit to create a windmill to bring electricity to his village. Williamâ€™s functioning windmill, created mostly from repurposed scrap, gained worldwide attention after he was invited to speak at a TED conference. This critically acclaimed book became a New York Times bestseller, was adapted into young reader and picture book formats, and inspired a 2019 film from Netflix.
