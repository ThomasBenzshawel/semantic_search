Though Papa is revered by the Christian community as a devout congregant and a benevolent provider, his religious fanaticism has turned him into a tyrannical persecutor within his home. Papa’s conversion to Christianity by European missionaries at a young age has shaped his entire life and has set up the cycle of physical abuse that he now views as necessary in order to walk a righteous path.  Papa’s beliefs in serving God and living a life of perfection in His honor dictate his iron-fisted rule over his family, and his oversized expectations set them up for constant failure. In the tears he sheds following his violent retributions for their perceived wrongdoings, he reveals that he himself feels punished for his own failures to keep his family holy. Because of his generosity to the Church, this physical abuse of his family goes unchecked by community members who might have the power to intervene and help correct his fiendish behavior. Papa’s role as publisher of the Standard also solidifies his untouchable status, as his newspaper is the only source of true information about government corruption and lies. Though Papa touts Christian values and rejects tyranny within the post-coup government, his manic devotion to God prevents him from understanding or stopping his cruel treatment of his family.
