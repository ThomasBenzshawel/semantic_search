Richard “Dick” Winters represents the moral compass and strategic strength of Easy Company. He is a college man from Pennsylvania. He doesn’t drink or smoke but doesn’t judge others for their choices. As one of the original officers during basic training in Toccoa and jump school in Georgia, he is the point of continuity throughout their entire service in World War II. Winters’s talented leadership and unflappable character foster a deep connection full of admiration and respect with his men. Even before he becomes the commanding officer of Easy Company, the men look up to him in such a way that he is their true leader. This causes friction between him and Captain Herbert Sobel, which in turn causes Captain Sobel to make several questionable command decisions.

Captain Sobel is later replaced before the company even sees action, and Lt. Winters eventually takes control of Easy Company, advancing to the rank of major through the culmination of World War II. Winters is a brilliant strategist who studied human nature with empathy. He has no patience for leaders who cavalierly put his men in harm’s way, and when that happens, he quietly ignores such orders. Winters is fearless in combat, and his leadership by example inspires his men to overcome their fear. Events unfold through the eyes of Winters, whose comments give context and moral interpretation. Winters admires the German discipline and commitment to excellence and always treats German prisoners with respect.
