					Inside Howards End, Margaret does not ask
					Helen to explain her pregnancy; nor does she ask
					who the father is.  She merely asks about Helen's
					situation--she is living in Munich with a journalist
					named Monica--and why Helen did not tell her what had
					happened.  At first, they seem far apart from one
					another, and their conversation is awkward; but as
					they look at all the old furniture from Wickham Place
					arranged in Howards End, they realize how much they
					love one another, and agree to spend the night
					together in the house.  Margaret goes back to
					Charles' house to ask Henry's permission.
					Shockingly, he denies it:  He expresses his desire to
					thrash Helen's "seducer" "within an inch of his
					life," but despite his own extramarital affair, he
					refuses to let a fallen woman such as Helen
					spend a night in his house.  Margaret furiously tries
					to show him his own hypocrisy, but he merely stalks
					away.  Margaret returns to Helen at Howards End.
				


					After Henry learned of Helen's condition, he called
					Charles to solicit his help; Charles immediately goes
					to see Tibby, whom he bullies into telling him
					the name of Leonard.  Drawing the false
					conclusion that Tibby condoned an affair between
					Helen and Leonard, and offered his rooms as a place
					for them to conduct the affair, Charles leaves Tibby
					in disgust.
				


					Outside, under the great wych-elm at Howards End,
					Helen tells Margaret the story of the night she slept
					with Leonard--the night of Evie's wedding,
					when she and Leonard talked in the hotel after
					Jacky had gone to sleep and the same night Margaret
					learned of Henry's affair with Jacky.  Helen asks
					Margaret to come to Germany with her, and Margaret,
					though she loves England deeply, considers the idea.
					Suddenly imagining that she, Helen, Henry, and the
					placid countryside around are all part of the dead
					Mrs. Wilcox's mind, she wonders whether
					Leonard is part of that mind as well.
				


					Henry's shockingly hypocritical reaction to
					Helen's pregnancy reveals his inner crisis; he is
					terribly unsure of how to act, so he simply does the
					most conventional thing imaginable at every turn.
					This behavior leads him into the horribly contradictory position
					of wishing to blame and punish Helen's seducer but
					refusing to let Helen spend a single night in
					his house.  Here, Margaret's philosophy of "Only
					connect" and Henry's philosophy of "Concentrate"
					crash headlong into each other.  Henry is
					concentrating so hard on ideas of social morality
					that he is unable to see that Helen is not guilty of
					anything he himself has not done.  She is actually
					less guilty, as Margaret points out:  Helen has only
					hurt herself, while Henry was unfaithful to Mrs.
					Wilcox.
				


					When Margaret, enraged, points this out to Henry in
					terms that even he cannot fail to understand, he
					falls to pieces, snarling his refusal once
					more and then shambling away.  As Forster points out
					in a narrative aside, Margaret's only hope of saving
					Henry lies in breaking him; as long as his outward
					edifice is secure, he will never learn to "connect."
					This scene in Chapter 38, though it does not complete
					the process of breaking Henry, certainly prepares him
					for the collapse he will experience after Charles
					is charged with manslaughter.
				


					Helen's confession that Leonard is the father of
					her unborn child serves to further entwine the fates
					of the three main groups of the novel--it is clear
					that the question of "Who will inherit England?" will
					not have a simple answer.  Of the two Schlegel
					sisters, one has married a Wilcox and the other will
					bear the child of a Bast.  The message is that the
					classes are mingling and the boundaries are becoming
					indistinct.  Howards End, like England, can no longer
					belong to any one group, and soon, the groups
					themselves will cease to exist as separate
					classifications.
