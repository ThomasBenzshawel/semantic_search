Darl, who speaks in nineteen of the novel’s fifty-nine
				sections, is in many ways its most cerebral character. Darl’s knack
				for probing analysis and poetic descriptions mean that his voice
				becomes the closest thing the story offers to a guiding, subjective
				narrator. Yet it is this same intellectual nature that prevents
				him from achieving either the flashy heroism of his brother Jewel
				or the self-sacrificing loyalty of his brother Cash. In fact, it
				prevents Darl from believing wholeheartedly in the family’s mission.
				Darl registers his objection to the entire burial outing by apparently
				abandoning his mother’s coffin during the botched river-crossing,
				and by setting fire to Gillespie’s barn with the eight-day-old corpse
				inside.

	Another consequence of Darl’s philosophical nature is
				his alienation from the community around him. According to Cora
				Tull, people find Darl strange and unsettling. He is also able to
				understand private things about the lives of the people around him,
				as he does when he guesses at Dewey Dell’s fling with Lafe or perceives that
				Anse is not Jewel’s real father. At times, Darl is almost clairvoyant,
				as evidenced by the scene in which he is able to describe vividly the
				scene at his mother’s death, even though he and Jewel are far away
				from the scene when she dies. Other characters alienate Darl for
				fear that he will get too close to them and their secrets. It is
				perhaps this fear, more than Darl’s act of arson, that leads his
				family to have him committed to an insane asylum at the end of the
				novel—after all, Dewey Dell, who realizes that Darl knows her sordid secret,
				is the first to restrain him when the officers from the asylum arrive.
