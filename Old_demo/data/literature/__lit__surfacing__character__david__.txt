David is the model of male dominance in Surfacing. David
				initially appears to be an ideal husband, as he jokes and flirts with Anna.
				However, Atwood twists her portrayal of David by revealing the cruelty that
				underscores his jokes and the emptiness of his flirtation. Under the guise of
				joking, David constantly tries to control Anna’s behavior. As the week
				progresses, he becomes overtly antagonistic toward her, calling her fat and
				snubbing her ideas, and eventually uses psychological cruelty to dominate her.
				He also objectifies Anna by referring to her body in front of Joe. The narrator
				recognizes that David’s flirtation serves as a display. She calls his banter
				with Anna a “skit,” noticing that both David and Anna drop their flirtation once
				they lose their audience.

David spews generic anti-American sentiment, calling the Americans pigs
				and proposing that they be thrown out of Canada. However, these anti-American
				politics lack substance. The best justification that David can muster for hating
				Americans is a ridiculous prediction of an American invasion of Canada. David
				possesses nearly all of the despicable characteristics the narrator comes to
				associate with Americans. Additionally, his own life seems at odds with his
				anti-American sentiments. David loves the distinctly American pastime of
				baseball, and he constantly laughs like the American cartoon character Woody
				Woodpecker. David’s political standing illustrates that Americans are marked by
				behaviors and not by nationality.
