The Hours, a novel by Michael Cunningham, was published in 1998 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1999. The novel interweaves the lives of three women across different time periods—Virginia Woolf in the 1920s, a housewife in the 1950s, and a New Yorker in the late 1990s. Connected by the novel Mrs. Dalloway, they grapple with societal expectations, personal identity, and the pursuit of happiness. The Hours was adapted into a film in 2002 that starred Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf.
