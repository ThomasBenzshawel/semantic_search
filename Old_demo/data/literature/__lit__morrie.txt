Tuesdays with Morrie by American author and journalist Mitch Albom, published in 1997, is a heartfelt memoir that chronicles Albom’s conversations with his former college sociology professor, Morrie Schwartz. The narrative unfolds through a series of meetings that take place on Tuesdays, during which Morrie imparts his wisdom on life, love, work, and death as he faces amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a terminal illness. The setting alternates between Morrie’s home in Massachusetts and the flashbacks to Albom’s college days at Brandeis University, capturing the essence of their unique and profound teacher-student relationship.

The setting of Morrie’s home, where the majority of their meetings occur, becomes a contemplative space for the discussions on the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. Albom skillfully weaves in flashbacks to his college years, offering readers glimpses into the past and the lessons that shaped his relationship with Morrie. The intimate and personal nature of the setting adds depth to the emotional resonance of the narrative. Historically, the memoir is set in the late 20th century, addressing the broader cultural context of that time. Morrie’s reflections provide a lens through which readers can reflect on their own lives.

In 1999, Tuesdays with Morrie was adapted into a film starring Hank Azaria as Mitch and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. The memoir transcends its historical setting by presenting universal themes that continue to resonate with readers across generations.
