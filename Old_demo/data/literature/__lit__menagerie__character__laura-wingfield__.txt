The physically and emotionally crippled Laura is the only
				character in the play who never does anything to hurt anyone else.
				Despite the weight of her own problems, she displays a pure compassion—as with
				the tears she sheds over Tom’s unhappiness, described by Amanda
				in Scene Four—that stands in stark contrast to the selfishness and
				grudging sacrifices that characterize the Wingfield household. Laura
				also has the fewest lines in the play, which contributes to her
				aura of selflessness. Yet she is the axis around which the plot turns,
				and the most prominent symbols—blue roses, the glass unicorn, the
				entire glass menagerie—all in some sense represent her. Laura is
				as rare and peculiar as a blue rose or a unicorn, and she is as delicate
				as a glass figurine.

Other characters seem to assume that, like a piece of
				transparent glass, which is colorless until light shines upon it,
				Laura can take on whatever color they wish. Thus, Amanda both uses
				the contrast between herself and Laura to emphasize the glamour
				of her own youth and to fuel her hope of re-creating that youth
				through Laura. Tom and Jim both see Laura as an exotic creature,
				completely and rather quaintly foreign to the rest of the world.
				Yet Laura’s crush on the high school hero, Jim, is a rather ordinary
				schoolgirl sentiment, and a girl as supposedly fragile as Laura
				could hardly handle the days she spends walking the streets in the
				cold to avoid going to typing class. Through actions like these,
				Laura repeatedly displays a will of her own that defies others’
				perceptions of her, and this will repeatedly goes unacknowledged.
