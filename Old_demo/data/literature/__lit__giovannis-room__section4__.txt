David recalls moving in with Giovanni in the spring and the routine they developed while together. A typical morning began with David picking up Giovanni from Guillaume’s bar, finding a place to have breakfast, and returning to Giovanni’s room. Unable to sleep right away, David and Giovanni drink cognac and coffee, smoke, and talk. David remembers a conversation with Giovanni one morning dealing with Hella’s eventual return to Paris. Giovanni finds Hella overbearing from David’s description of her, especially since David and Hella are not married, and wonders if she herself is not having a steamy affair with a Spaniard. 

Believing that Hella will return to Paris soon, David alludes that he and Giovanni will not be able to see each other for fear of Hella discovering their secret and David not wanting to hurt Hella. Giovanni attempts to convince David that their affair is not something to be afraid of or even something to consider as dirty, though David lashes back and says that in the United States what they are doing is considered illegal. These conversations always take a heated turn, until David and Giovanni stop talking and fall asleep. At around three or four each afternoon, David walks Giovanni to Guillaume’s bar. David remembers the specific afternoon he felt genuine love for Giovanni and the joy he felt being with him. Simultaneously, however, David acknowledges a bourgeoning sense of hate and ambivalence toward Giovanni.
