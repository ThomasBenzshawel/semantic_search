Cyrano is courageous, poetic, witty, and eloquent.
				He is a remarkable fighter, poet, musician, and philosopher, as
				well as a lover of beauty, ideals, and values.
				Never presented in a bad or unflattering light, Cyrano is difficult
				to dislike. Throughout the play, Cyrano acts according to his uncompromising
				sense of values and morals. He remains steadfast in his pursuit
				to become an honorable man and comes to represent the kind of man
				that everyone would like to be—and more.

	Cyrano displays bravado reminiscent of the warrior tradition, never
				talking himself or others out of a fight. Cyrano’s brashness has earned
				him many enemies. His lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem,
				however, prove to be his most potent adversaries. More powerful
				than the simple flaw from which they grew—his nose—Cyrano’s insecurities
				prevent him from attaining what he cherishes most: love. His inner
				beauty wins over everyone, but he, and only he, fails to forget
				about his large nose. In public, Cyrano appears heroic, possessed
				of an extraordinary wit and a dizzying array of skills. His private
				self, however, is dark and despondent. Rather than marring his image,
				the few flaws that Cyrano possesses appear so fundamental to the
				human condition that they evoke an even deeper appreciation of his
				character.

	Cyrano never wavers in his commitment to Roxane, but
				he may not be truly in love with her. Perhaps he is in love with
				the idea of love and of being in love. After all, Cyrano worships
				and obeys the magic, mystery, and poetry of love, as well as the
				powers and art of romance. Delighted by the romantic challenge of
				dying for love, Cyrano allows love to kill him in the end, even
				after Roxane discovers and reciprocates his feelings.
