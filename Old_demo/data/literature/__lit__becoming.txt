Becoming is the 2018 memoir by former First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama—one of the best-selling memoirs of all time. She describes her life growing up in Chicago, her career, and her marriage to Barack Obama, the first Black president of the United States. Obama explores the commitment to the country and the hopes to improve people’s lives that led her to support her husband’s political goals, as well as her struggle to protect her daughters’ childhoods and to retain her own identity while serving as First Lady. The audio version of Becoming won the 2020 Grammy for spoken word.
