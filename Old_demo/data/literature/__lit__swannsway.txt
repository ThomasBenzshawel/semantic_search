Swann’s Way is a novel by French author Marcel Proust that was first published in 1913. It is the first and best-known volume in Proust’s seven-title work In Search of Lost Time (À la recherche du temps perdu), which is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest literary achievements of all time. In these works, Proust looks back—with a combination of nostalgia and regret—to the relatively peaceful, culture-rich era of French history starting in the 1870s and ending with the build-up to World War I that known as the la belle époque (the beautiful era).
