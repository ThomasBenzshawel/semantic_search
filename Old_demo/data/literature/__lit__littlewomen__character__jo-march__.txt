The main character of Little Women, Jo
				is an outspoken tomboy with a passion for writing. Her character
				is based in large part on Louisa May Alcott herself. Jo refuses
				Laurie’s offer of marriage, despite the fact that everyone assumes
				they will end up together. In the end, Jo gives up her writing and
				marries Professor Bhaer, which can be seen either as a domestic
				triumph or as a professional loss, since Jo loses her headstrong
				independence. 

	Because she displays good and bad traits in equal measure,
				Jo is a very unusual character for nineteenth-century didactic fiction.
				Jo’s bad traits—her rebelliousness, anger, and outspoken ways—do
				not make her unappealing; rather, they suggest her humanity. Jo
				is a likely precursor to a whole slew of lovably flawed heroes and
				heroines of children’s books, among them Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer.
