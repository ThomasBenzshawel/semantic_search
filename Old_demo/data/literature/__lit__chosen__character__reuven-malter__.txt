Potok chooses Reuven to narrate The Chosen,
				even though the novel’s central conflict is Danny’s desire to break
				away from his obligation to inherit his father’s position as Tzaddik.
				Reuven works well as a narrator because we share his position as
				a curious outsider looking in on the unfamiliar, secret world of
				Hasidism. Reuven is a more accessible character than Danny; it is
				more difficult for us to relate to Danny’s unique genius and his
				Hasidic lifestyle. At the same time, these aspects of Danny’s character
				make him very interesting, and as narrator, Reuven is able to instill
				in us the same fascination with Danny that Reuven himself feels.	

Reuven’s presence also reminds us that The Chosen is
				not just the story of Danny’s struggle between his obligation to
				the traditions of his family and the possibilities of a modern,
				secular society. Reuven also deals with conflicts and change. Through
				his interactions with Danny and Reb Saunders, his perspective on
				the world is broadened. He deepens his empathy for others and enlarges
				his intellect. Both Reuven and Danny are protagonists, and each
				is central to developing the novel’s themes and driving its plot.
				Potok’s focus on two protagonists instead of one underscores the
				importance of friendships and relationships to the novel, and the
				related ideas of reciprocity, choice, and compromise.
