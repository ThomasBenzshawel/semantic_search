The monster is Victor Frankenstein’s creation, assembled
from old body parts and strange chemicals, animated by a mysterious
spark. He enters life eight feet tall and enormously strong but
with the mind of a newborn. Abandoned by his creator and confused,
he tries to integrate himself into society, only to be shunned universally. Looking
in the mirror, he realizes his physical grotesqueness, an aspect
of his persona that blinds society to his initially gentle, kind nature.
Seeking revenge on his creator, he kills Victor’s younger brother.
After Victor destroys his work on the female monster meant to ease
the monster’s solitude, the monster murders Victor’s best friend
and then his new wife.

While Victor feels unmitigated hatred for his creation,
the monster shows that he is not a purely evil being. The monster’s
eloquent narration of events (as provided by Victor) reveals his
remarkable sensitivity and benevolence. He assists a group of poor
peasants and saves a girl from drowning, but because of his outward
appearance, he is rewarded only with beatings and disgust. Torn
between vengefulness and compassion, the monster ends up lonely
and tormented by remorse. Even the death of his creator-turned-would-be-destroyer
offers only bittersweet relief: joy because Victor has caused him
so much suffering, sadness because Victor is the only person with
whom he has had any sort of relationship.
