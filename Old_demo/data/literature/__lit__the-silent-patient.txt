The Silent Patient, a psychological thriller, is the 2019 debut novel of British-Cypriot novelist and screenwriter Alex Michaelides. Inspired by the author’s own time working in a mental care facility as well as the murder mysteries of Agatha Christie, the novel follows English psychiatrist Theo Faber as he treats Alicia Berenson, a successful artist who stops speaking after seemingly murdering her husband in their London home. Alternating between Theo’s narration in the present and Alicia’s diary entries in the days leading up to the murder, the novel explores the relationship between therapist and patient, the accessibility of mental health care resources, and the enduring impact of childhood trauma.
