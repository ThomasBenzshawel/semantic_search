Sarcastic and judgmental, Tibby approaches her summer
				at Wallman’s as she approaches life in general: she expects to be
				miserable, and she assumes everyone around her is ridiculous. Tibby
				has a nose ring and former-hippie parents, and she views the world
				through skeptical, wary eyes. She has always had a unique outlook
				on life, especially since she attends an “alternative” school and
				has been with her parents through various careers, including organic
				farming. Tibby’s wariness and skepticism don’t stop her from being
				a loyal, devoted friend. She loves her friends and is a source of
				stability for them. They rely on her to take their side no matter
				what, and Tibby proves infinitely willing to condemn the whole world
				if it’ll make her friends feel better. She may judge others harshly,
				but she never judges her friends—no matter what they do. Although
				Tibby is disappointed to spend the summer alone in Bethesda, she
				doesn’t just sit around moping. Instead, she turns her experiences
				into art by making a documentary in which she records the perceived
				utter boredom and inanity of her hometown.

When Tibby meets Bailey, she looks no further than Bailey’s
				very young age and annoying persistence, certain that Bailey is
				just a pest to be ignored and tossed aside. However, Tibby’s usual
				dismissiveness is challenged when she finds out that Bailey has
				cancer. Tibby eventually opens up to Bailey, finding a true friend.
				She realizes that Bailey has a lot to teach her about compassion,
				openness, and happiness, and she learns from Bailey how to see what’s
				inside of people who may, on the outside, look like losers or fools.
				Tibby ultimately gains a new perspective on life, and she is more
				willing to live her life fully, opening herself up to others in
				a way she hasn’t done before.
