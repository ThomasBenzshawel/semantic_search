Throughout The Jungle, Sinclair’s characters
				are not so much well-rounded, believable characters as they are
				representative figures of the immigrant working class as a whole.
				The greatest evidence of Sinclair’s use of Jurgis to garner sympathy
				and admiration is that he doesn’t possess any true character flaw.
				When he acts immorally or selfishly, as when he goes out drinking
				after Ona’s death or abandons the family after Antanas’s death,
				we are always meant to understand that he does so out of the hurt
				and misery that his environment forces upon him. Jurgis’s characteristics
				are designed to make him appealing to the average American reader
				of 1906, and at the beginning of the novel,
				he has no unsympathetic traits. He is young, strong, optimistic,
				energetic, devoted to his family, and enthusiastic about his new
				country. He has a powerful belief in the American Dream—the idea
				that hard work will beget rewards. When Ona worries about the debt
				that their wedding feast will force them to assume, Jurgis earnestly
				promises, “I will work harder,” as though doing so will guarantee
				material success.

As Jurgis’s idealism and naïveté are slowly ground into
				oblivion by the oppressive conditions of life in Packingtown, the
				pain causes Jurgis to act out of character for long periods of time.
				The values with which he first equips himself in his pursuit of
				happiness begin to seem irrelevant: he uses his earnings to drink
				heavily instead of saving, he abandons his family, and he turns
				to corruption and crime as a source of income. But at no point are
				we meant to judge Jurgis harshly or think that he is simply an immoral,
				uncaring person. On the contrary, we are supposed to bear in mind
				that he is the exact opposite sort of person. Jurgis
				presents an idealized portrait of the working poor; his degradation
				illustrates how capitalism fails the working class.
