Tea Cake functions as the catalyst that helps
drive Janie toward her goals. Like all of the other men in Janie’s
life, he plays only a supporting role. Before his arrival, Janie
has already begun to find her own voice, as is demonstrated when
she finally stands up to Jody. As we see at the end of the novel,
after Tea Cake’s death, Janie remains strong and hopeful; therefore,
it’s fair to say that Janie is not dependent on Tea Cake. Nevertheless,
he does play a crucial role in her development.

When she meets Tea Cake, Janie has already begun
to develop a strong, proud sense of self, but Tea Cake accelerates
this spiritual growth. Ever since her moment under the pear tree,
Janie has known that she will find what she is searching for only
through love. In Tea Cake she finds a creative and vivacious personality
who enjoys probing the world around him and respects Janie’s need
to develop. Whereas Logan treats her like a farm animal and Jody
silences her, Tea Cake converses and plays with her. Instead of
stifling her personality, he encourages it, introducing her to new
experiences and skills.

While Tea Cake is vital to Janie’s development, he is
not an indispensable part of her life, a crucial truth that is revealed
when Janie shoots him. He plays a role in her life, helping her
to better understand herself. By teaching her how to shoot a gun,
ironically, he provides her with the tools that ultimately kill
him. Janie’s decision to save herself rather than yield her life
up to the crazy Tea Cake points to her increasing sense of self
and demonstrates that Tea Cake’s ultimate function in the novel
is not to make Janie dependent on him for happiness but to help
her find happiness and security within herself.
