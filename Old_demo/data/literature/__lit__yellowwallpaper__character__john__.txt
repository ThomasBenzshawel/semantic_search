Though John seems like the obvious villain of “The Yellow Wallpaper,” the
				story does not allow us to see him as wholly evil. John’s treatment of the
				narrator’s depression goes terribly wrong, but in all likelihood he was trying
				to help her, not make her worse. The real problem with John is the
				all-encompassing authority he has in his combined role as the narrator’s husband
				and doctor. John is so sure that he knows what’s best for his wife that he
				disregards her own opinion of the matter, forcing her to hide her true feelings.
				He consistently patronizes her. He calls her “a blessed little goose” and vetoes
				her smallest wishes, such as when he refuses to switch bedrooms so as not to
				overindulge her “fancies.” Further, his dry, clinical rationality renders him
				uniquely unsuited to understand his imaginative wife. He does not intend to harm
				her, but his ignorance about what she really needs ultimately proves dangerous.

John knows his wife only superficially. He sees the “outer pattern” but
				misses the trapped, struggling woman inside. This ignorance is why John is no
				mere cardboard villain. He cares for his wife, but the unequal relationship in
				which they find themselves prevents him from truly understanding her and her
				problems. By treating her as a “case” or a “wife” and not as a person with a
				will of her own, he helps destroy her, which is the last thing he wants. That
				John has been destroyed by this imprisoning relationship is made clear by the
				story’s chilling finale. After breaking in on his insane wife, John faints in
				shock and goes unrecognized by his wife, who calls him “that man” and complains
				about having to “creep over him” as she makes her way along the wall.
