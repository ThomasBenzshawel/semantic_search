Hawkeye, the protagonist of the novel, goes by several
				names: Natty Bumppo, La Longue Carabine (The Long Rifle), the scout, and
				Hawkeye. Hawkeye stars in several of Cooper’s novels, which are
				known collectively as the Leatherstocking Tales. Hawkeye’s chief
				strength is adaptability. He adapts to the difficulties of the frontier
				and bridges the divide between white and Indian cultures. A hybrid,
				Hawkeye identifies himself by his white race and his Indian social
				world, in which his closest friends are the Mohicans Chingachgook
				and Uncas. 

Hawkeye’s hybrid background breeds both productive alliances and
				disturbingly racist convictions. On one hand, Hawkeye cherishes
				individuality and makes judgments without regard to race. He cherishes
				Chingachgook for his value as an individual, not for a superficial
				multiculturalism fashionably ahead of its time. On the other hand,
				Hawkeye demonstrates an almost obsessive investment in his own “genuine”
				whiteness. Also, while Hawkeye supports interracial friendship between
				men, he objects to interracial sexual desire between men and women.
				Because of his contradictory opinions, the protagonist of The
					Last of the Mohicans embodies nineteenth-century America’s
				ambivalence about race and nature. Hawkeye’s most racist views predict
				the cultural warfare around the issue of race that continues to
				haunt the United States.
