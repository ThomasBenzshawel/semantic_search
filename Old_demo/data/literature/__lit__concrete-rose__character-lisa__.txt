Lisa is Mav’s girlfriend. Later, she is the mother of his young daughter. Lisa is quick to shut Mav down when his actions are hurtful, but she always leaves the door open for reconciliation. She speaks her mind and sticks up for herself when she is angry. She always knows when Mav is hiding something or when he is trying to change the subject, and she always calls him out on it.

Lisa and Mav are different in many ways, chiefly that Lisa comes from a more privileged socio-economic background. Unlike Mav, Lisa takes the long view of the future and desires to go to college to make a better life for himself. She encourages Mav to think this way, too. Lisa places her own and her unborn child’s interests first but does not make unkind or immoral decisions to do so. Even when she is cautiously optimistic about the kind of man that Mav could be and makes plans with him as a co-parent, she does not lead him on with false promises about becoming a romantic couple. She will wait and see what kind of father Mav will be to their daughter.
