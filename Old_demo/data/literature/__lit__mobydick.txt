Moby-Dick is a novel written by Herman Melville, first published in 1851. The story is narrated by Ishmael, a sailor who joins the whaling ship Pequod, commanded by the obsessive Captain Ahab. Ahab is driven by an unrelenting quest for revenge against a white sperm whale, Moby-Dick, which had bitten off Ahab’s leg at the knee during a previous encounter. The novel investigates themes of obsession, fate, and the complex relationship between humanity and nature, using the whale as a symbol of the sublime and the unknowable.

Set in the early 19th century, Moby-Dick reflects the historical context of the American whaling industry. Melville draws on his own experiences as a sailor to provide a detailed and realistic portrayal of the whaling process, as well as the diverse crew members aboard the Pequod. The novel also delves into the economic, social, and philosophical aspects of the time, exploring the interconnectedness of humanity, nature, and the pursuit of knowledge. Contemporary readers appreciate Moby-Dick for its rich symbolism, philosophical depth, and the exploration of existential themes. Melville’s intricate narrative style, blending adventure, symbolism, and philosophical musings, has contributed to the novel’s enduring status as a classic of American literature.

While initially met with mostly negative reviews and poor sales, Moby-Dick gained recognition for its literary innovation and profound exploration of the human condition starting in the years after Melville died in obscurity in 1891. By the mid-20th century, the novel’s reputation had solidified among scholars as being one of the best American novels ever written or the best. In 1956, author Ray Bradbury worked on the screenplay for a lavish film adaptation called Moby Dick directed by John Huston and starring Gregory Peck as Ahab and Richard Basehart as Ishmael.
