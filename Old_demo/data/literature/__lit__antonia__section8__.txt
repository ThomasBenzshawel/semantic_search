It was no wonder that her sons stood
					tall and straight. She was a rich mine of life, like the founders
					of early races.	

Some twenty years later, Jim returns to Nebraska on his
					way home to New York from a business trip out west. His intention
					is to see Ántonia, of whom he has heard almost nothing in the intervening period
					except that she has married a fellow Bohemian named Cuzak and is
					raising a large family.

When his buggy arrives at the Cuzak farm, Jim is led up
					to the house by two young boys and welcomed into the kitchen by
					two older girls. As he prepares to sit down, Ántonia enters the
					room, but she fails to recognize him initially. Once she does, she
					is thrown into a rush of emotion and calls out to gather her children
					around her. Introductions are made, and Ántonia and Jim sit down
					in the kitchen to discuss old times and new times.

During their conversation, one of Ántonia’s boys comes
					into the house to mourn the death of his dog. Ántonia consoles him,
					and the Cuzaks take Jim on a tour of their new fruit cave. Afterward,
					Jim is taken through the farmhouse and then on to the orchard. Another long
					talk of times gone by ensues, and Ántonia invites Jim to stay the night
					with them. Jim expresses his wish to sleep in the haymow with her
					sons, and Ántonia goes off to prepare supper while Jim heads out
					to milk cows with the boys.

At supper the group crowds into the kitchen, and afterward everyone
					settles in the parlor for some musical entertainment by the Cuzak
					children. After the concert, Ántonia brings out a box of photographs,
					and the children gather around as their mother leads Jim through
					the pictures. Ántonia tells stories until eleven, when Jim and the
					boys retire to the barn. The boys’ giggles quickly give way to slumber,
					but Jim lays awake late into the night, thinking of Ántonia.

The next morning, Jim dresses in the barn and washes up
					by the windmill, entering the kitchen to find breakfast ready. In
					the afternoon, Cuzak returns with his oldest son and introduces
					him to Jim. Cuzak begins to describe the details of their trip into
					town, including a dance at which they encountered many of Ántonia’s
					Bohemian acquaintances. Back at the house, as Ántonia serves a supper
					of geese and apples, the talk turns to Black Hawk, and the story
					of the violent murder-suicide involving Wick Cutter and his wife.

After the meal, Cuzak and Jim take a walk into the orchard,
					and Cuzak recounts for Jim the details of his early life. Confessing
					a loneliness for his old haunts in Bohemia and Vienna, Cuzak explains
					that the warmth of Ántonia’s love and the energy of his large family
					has kept him free from despair.

The following day, after dinner, Jim leaves the Cuzaks.
					The whole family gathers to see him off as he departs, and Jim pulls
					away in the buggy as Ántonia waves her apron in farewell by the
					windmill.

In Black Hawk the next day, Jim is disappointed by the
					unfamiliar town, and is hard-pressed to occupy himself until the
					night express train arrives. Toward evening, Jim walks out beyond
					the outskirts of town and finds himself at home again. In his wanderings,
					he comes upon the first bit of the old road that leads out to the country
					farms. Although the track has largely been plowed under, Jim easily
					recognizes the way. He sits down by the overgrowth and watches the
					haystacks glowing in the sunlight.

With twenty years gone by since their last encounter,
					it is no surprise that Ántonia fails to recognize Jim immediately
					when he arrives at her farm. Because of the interval in their acquaintance,
					it also follows that Jim’s description of Ántonia should be an odd
					mixture of the familiar and the strange. He refers to her in one
					breath as “this woman” and in the next insists that her eyes could
					be none other than her own.

As the two warm up to each other, the awkwardness of lost
					time fades into the background, and Ántonia and Jim begin to enjoy
					each other’s company in their old easy way. As Jim remembers, with
					the face-to-face encounter “the changes grew less apparent to me,
					her identity stronger.” Still, Ántonia does not expect to find Jim
					childless, and this fact throws him into stark contrast with Ántonia,
					a mother to a large family. The difference in their domestic status owes
					perhaps to the difference in their environments: Jim, as an urban
					white-collar worker, has less need to rear children than the poor,
					farm-bound Cuzaks, who need all the labor they can get.

Ántonia is as invested in her relationship with the landscape
					as ever, as demonstrated by her carefully cultivated orchard. She endows
					the trees around her with human qualities, declaring much as Jim
					does earlier in his childhood that she loves them “as if they were
					people” and explaining that as she cared for them in their first growth
					“they were on my mind like children.” Jim quickly reintegrates himself
					into such a landscape-oriented life in the countryside, and feels
					as he milks the cows with Ántonia’s sons that “everything was as
					it should be.”

In bringing out a box of photographs to display, Ántonia
					returns to a tangible resource that provokes a flood of memories.
					By educating her children in the tales of her past, she has made
					her past a part of her present, and the photographs help the memory
					of those old stories to live on. Memory lives largely on the strength
					of images, photographic or otherwise, and in recalling his feelings
					for Ántonia, Jim runs through a series of pictures from the past
					in his own head. At the same time, he finds that Ántonia “still
					had that something which fires the imagination,” and is every bit
					as moved by the images of his return visit as he has been all these
					years by the pictures from his childhood.

Ultimately, more than the photographs or the mental images,
					it is the surrounding prairie landscape that comes to serve as an
					icon of the childhood idyll that Ántonia and Jim earlier share.
					After parting once again from Ántonia, Jim finds resolution and
					strength in a walk among the familiar, silent places of his youth,
					illustrating how the past still has a tremendous power to comfort
					him.

Although the road leading out to the old farms is largely
					grown over, it still serves as a useful landmark to those aware
					of its presence. Likewise, the map of memory is a key to the present
					for those who have lived through the past. In returning to his roots,
					Jim is taken by “what a little circle man’s experience is” and resolves
					to renew his relationship with Ántonia and develop a bond with her family.
					Regardless of the missing years between them, Jim finds the key
					to a future with his childhood friend in the richness of what they hold
					in common—“the precious, the incommunicable past.” Jim meditates
					on this shared past once again as the landscape closest to his heart
					lies quietly beneath the darkness that surrounds him.
