Caroline Fisher is a meticulous, conscientious woman who was raised in a military family. She works hard to keep the family organized. Mrs. Fisher is close with Paul and takes him on errands with her.  She genuinely feels bad when she realizes she dashed Paul’s chances on the soccer team at Lake Windsor by signing him up as a special needs student at school. When Mrs. Fisher first arrives in Lake Windsor Downs, she notices immediately the flaws in their neighborhood; there are constant muck fires, the local fire department is a joke, and one neighbor has unsightly lightning rods on his home. Unafraid to take control of a situation, she joins the Housing Development Committee and soon becomes head of the development’s Architectural Committee. Mrs. Fisher is the voice of reason in the novel. She calls community meetings to get football practice moved after Mike Costello dies and calls her neighbors together when she finds out her son Erik is behind the recent robberies to make restitutions to them. Despite all her conscientiousness, Mrs. Fisher has trouble seeing Paul’s emotional struggles and facing Erik’s sociopathic tendencies. She’s more concerned with appearances and tries to hold everything together, not realizing that she’s built a family on a crumbling foundation of lies. Mrs. Fisher’s relationship with her father, Paul’s “grandpop,” is revealed at the end of the novel to be based on similarly shaky ground.
