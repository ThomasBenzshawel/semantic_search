Kino, The Pearl’s protagonist, is an
				extremely simple character, motivated by basic drives: his love
				for his family, loyalty to the traditions of his village and his
				people, and frustration at his people’s oppression at the hands
				of their European colonizers. Kino also possesses a quick mind and
				a strong work ethic, and he feels a close, pure kinship with the
				natural world, the source of his livelihood.

At the beginning of the novella, Kino is essentially
				content with his life. However, two seemingly chance occurrences—Coyotito’s scorpion
				sting and Kino’s discovery of the pearl—open Kino’s eyes to a larger
				world. As Kino begins to covet material wealth and education for
				his son, his simple existence becomes increasingly complicated by
				greed, conflict, and violence. The basic trajectory of Kino’s character
				is a gradual decline from a state of innocence to a state of corruption
				and disillusionment. The forces propelling this decline are ambition
				and greed. At the end of the novella, Kino’s tranquil relationship
				with nature has been perverted and reversed, a change signified
				by the fact that Kino finds the sounds of the animals at night threatening
				rather than reassuring.

Because The Pearl is a parable, Kino’s
				character can be interpreted in many ways. It can be seen as a critique
				of colonial politics, an exploration of how good motives can bring
				a person to a bad end, or even an attack on the idea of the American
				dream. But on the most basic level, Kino represents the dangers
				of ambition and greed. Kino’s ruin, caused by his lust for the pearl,
				illustrates the extent to which ambition and greed poison and jeopardize
				every aspect of a human’s familial, cultural, and personal well-being.
