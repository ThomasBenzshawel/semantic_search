After gaining popularity as an online blog, Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid was published as a graphic novel in 2007 as the first book in a comedic series of the same name. The coming-of-age novel chronicles Greg Heffley’s year of middle school in diary form. Throughout the school year, Greg writes diary entries that humorously tackle tough issues like popularity, bullying, masculinity, family, loyalty, self-esteem, and friendship. The book became a New York Times best seller and spawned a feature film and a line of Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and merchandise.
