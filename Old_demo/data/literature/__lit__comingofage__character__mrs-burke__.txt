Mrs. Burke is one of the numerous white women for whom Anne works as a maid. The nastiest and most blatantly racist, she is the closest portrait of prejudice in the book. Though Mrs. Burke ultimately gives Anne grudging respect, she still distrusts the majority of Black Americans and remains ardently opposed to integration. Mrs. Burke demonstrates just how senseless and destructive the whitesâ€™ prejudice is against Black people.
