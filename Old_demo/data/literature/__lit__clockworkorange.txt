A Clockwork Orange, published in 1962, is a dystopian novel by British author Anthony Burgess that explores the nature of evil and the limits of free will. The novel is narrated by Alex, a young man who leads a gang of “droogs” and takes pleasure in “ultra-violence.” After being arrested and convicted of murder, Alex undergoes an experimental procedure that is intended to cure him of his violent tendencies. In 1971, Stanley Kubrick adapted the novel into a controversial film that was widely acclaimed but also criticized for its graphic violence.
