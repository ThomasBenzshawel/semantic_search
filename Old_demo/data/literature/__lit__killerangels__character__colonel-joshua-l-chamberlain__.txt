Chamberlain is the main Union voice in the novel. He provides
				a different view of the war than that of Lee or Longstreet, since
				as a colonel, he is significantly lower in rank than they. But Chamberlain
				is one of the most interesting Union soldiers of the Civil War,
				and certainly one of the most popular. Chamberlain led a fascinating
				life. He was a professor at Bowdoin College at the time of the war,
				left the college to fight, and distinguished himself as an excellent
				soldier by the end of the war. It was Chamberlain who accepted the
				surrender of the Confederate forces at Appomattox. The novel tries
				to strike a delicate balance between describing Chamberlain as a
				college professor and as a soldier. Compared to many of his fellow
				soldiers, he is quite educated and thoughtful. For many, he is the
				easiest character with which to identify, since he is not only a
				citizen-turned-soldier, but is also lower ranked than the
				generals. Chamberlain is the idealized citizen-soldier, the man
				who chooses to forsake his comfortable job for his country and lives
				to become a renowned soldier.

	Throughout the novel, Chamberlain constantly evaluates
				everything he sees, often poetically. He analyzes what he sees around
				him, and he has a much closer, more hands-on experience with the
				battle than many of Shaara’s other characters. He is also in a difficult
				position because his brother, Tom, is one of his aides. Chamberlain
				realizes during the novel that he may be required to order Tom into harm’s
				way, perhaps even to his death. Chamberlain is the soldier with
				the soul of a poet, and he provides the novel with some of its best
				and most insightful analysis of the feelings and motivations of Union
				soldiers during the Civil War.
