Ed’s mother Bev has an ugly case of bitterness. Her aspirations for prosperity rode on her husband Gregor whose alcoholism ended up killing him. Whether Gregor began drinking when Bev started an affair or Bev’s affair started because of his drinking is a moot point after his death. Bev’s guilt and resentment festered until she transferred it to Ed. Bev blames her misery on anything and anyone but herself. When Ed observes her meeting her lover, he sees her as an individual and not as his mother. He then realizes Bev must accept her part in the collapse of her marriage and the disappointment in her life. Their confrontation rebalances the relationship between mother and son.
