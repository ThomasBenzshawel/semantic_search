In an interview presented in Edward Abramson’s book Chaim Potok, Potok
				says that a “teacher should be somebody like Reuven Malter’s father.
				In many ways he exemplifies the Jewish adventure.” David Malter
				represents the ideal American Jewish father. He combines religious
				rigor with scientific inquiry and a love of knowledge, all of which
				he tempers with his overwhelming love and respect for his son. Throughout
				the book, David Malter displays a profound tolerance of and respect
				for a variety of traditions. His open-minded spiritual and intellectual
				rigor represents the balanced perspective that both boys want to
				achieve. He is an individual who understands the importance of relationships
				and reciprocity, and he values and accepts the dual perspectives
				of tradition and secularism. 

David Malter’s perfection makes him the novel’s most one-dimensional,
				static character, but his character does evolve in one crucial way.
				After he learns about the Holocaust, we see him change from a gentle,
				mellow father into an impassioned Zionist activist. David Malter
				states his motivations for his ceaseless Zionist activity clearly
				in Chapter 13, when he explains to Reuven
				that a “man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically
				given to life.” This statement reflects David Malter’s growing feeling
				that it is not enough to wait passively for biblical prophesy, as
				Reb Saunders does. Rather, David Malter feels it is up to mankind
				to actively give meaning to the world and make sense of the horrible
				suffering of the Holocaust. As Sternlicht explains, the only way
				for David Malter to make sense of the Holocaust is for the Holocaust
				to incite the Jewish people’s return to the ancient land of Israel.
				Unlike Reb Saunders, David Malter believes that religion should
				impact politics, and that it is important for Jews to actively engage
				the outside world.
