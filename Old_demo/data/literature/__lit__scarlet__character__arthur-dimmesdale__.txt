Arthur Dimmesdale, like Hester Prynne, is an individual
whose identity owes more to external circumstances than to his innate nature.
The reader is told that Dimmesdale was a scholar of some renown
at Oxford University. His past suggests that he is probably somewhat
aloof, the kind of man who would not have much natural sympathy
for ordinary men and women. However, Dimmesdale has an unusually
active conscience. The fact that Hester takes all of the blame for
their shared sin goads his conscience, and his resultant mental
anguish and physical weakness open up his mind and allow him to
empathize with others. Consequently, he becomes an eloquent and
emotionally powerful speaker and a compassionate leader, and his
congregation is able to receive meaningful spiritual guidance from
him.

Ironically, the townspeople do not believe Dimmesdale’s
protestations of sinfulness. Given his background and his penchant
for rhetorical speech, Dimmesdale’s congregation generally interprets his
sermons allegorically rather than as expressions of any personal guilt.
This drives Dimmesdale to further internalize his guilt and self-punishment
and leads to still more deterioration in his physical and spiritual
condition. The town’s idolization of him reaches new heights after
his Election Day sermon, which is his last. In his death, Dimmesdale
becomes even more of an icon than he was in life. Many believe his
confession was a symbolic act, while others believe Dimmesdale’s
fate was an example of divine judgment.
