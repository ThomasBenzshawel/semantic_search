Of all the characters in Childhood's End, George Greggson, in his simple yet insightful observation of the events of the twenty-first century, probably comes the closest to being a protagonist. It is George's own children who begin the unstoppable processes of change that eventually lead to the transformation of mankind into a part of an intergalactic "Overmind." But George lacks an important aspect of being a protagonist: his character is not particularly dynamic. Indeed, his role is a very passive one. He is a witness to the fulfillment of the Overlords' plans, watching his own children change into something much greater than humanity has ever produced. George is an observer, and his role is to give the reader an ordinary man's perspective on this final period of human history.
