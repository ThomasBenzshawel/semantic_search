In creating the character of Rose of Sharon, Steinbeck
				relies heavily on stereotypes. We read that pregnancy has transformed
				the girl from a “hoyden”—a high-spirited and saucy girl—into a secretive and
				mysterious woman. Time and again, Steinbeck alludes to the girl’s
				silent self-containment and her impenetrable smile. This portrayal
				of pregnancy may initially seem to bespeak a romanticism out of
				keeping with Steinbeck’s characteristic realism. However, Steinbeck
				uses such seemingly trite details to prepare Rose of Sharon for the
				dramatic role she plays at the end of the novel. When she meets the
				starving man in the barn, she becomes saintly, otherworldly. Her capacity
				to sustain life, paired with her suffering and grief for her dead
				child, liken her to the Virgin Mother and suggest that there is hope
				to be found even in the bleakest of circumstances.
