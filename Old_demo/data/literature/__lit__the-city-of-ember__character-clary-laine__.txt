Like Doon’s father, Clary must also notice small things to do well at her job, and she does this without ever tiring of the small miracles. Despite the solitary nature of working alone with plants, Clary is a good communicator, and she serves as a sounding board for Lina while also offering her own wisdom. Lina seeks out Clary because her presence brings her clarity, not just because of the calming environment of the greenhouse but because Clary’s very presence is calming as well.
