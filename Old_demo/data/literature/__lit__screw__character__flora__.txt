Like Miles, Flora might be either angelic or diabolical.
				She appears to be a completely wonderful little girl, even preternaturally
				so, well behaved and a pleasure to be around. The governess thinks
				Flora possesses “extraordinary charm” and is the “most beautiful
				child” she has laid eyes on. Flora seems, however, to have a personality
				quite distinct from these glowing descriptions. When the governess
				questions Flora as to why she had been looking out the window, Flora’s
				explanation is evasive and unsatisfying. Flora’s next turn at the window
				turns out to be, according to Miles, part of a scheme to show the
				governess that Miles can be “bad.” At this point, the governess
				has already assumed Flora to be conniving and deceptive, but this
				is the first instance in which Flora seems to be exhibiting unambiguous
				deceit. The story remains inconclusive, however, and we never know
				for sure what Flora and Miles are up to. Flora may very well be
				the innocent child the governess thought her to be, her strange,
				diabolical turns existing only in the governess’s mind.
