In many ways, Milton begins where Shadrach leaves off in the education of Shadrach. Both men take an interest in Jethro because they see the enormous potential in him, and they want to help bring it to fruition. Milton stands up for Jethro when men in the store in Newton become angry about Bill's decision to fight for the South. Milton happily extends generosity to Jethro, perhaps treating him as if he were a son. Milton encourages Jethro to read the papers and to read a book on proper speech that Milton wrote. When something happens in the war that is either difficult to accept or difficult to interpret, Milton and Jethro talk about it. The prophetic statement, "peace will not be a perfect pearl," is one of Milton's most poignant truisms. Milton's love for Jethro extends to the Creightons as a family, as Milton persuades Matt to let him accompany Jenny to Washington D.C.
