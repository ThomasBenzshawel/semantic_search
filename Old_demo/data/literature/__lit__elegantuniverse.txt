The Elegant Universe is a nonfiction work by American physicist and popular science writer Brian Greene that was first published in 1999. In the work, Greene takes a non-technical approach to explaining string and superstring theory to a popular audience. The book achieved impressive sales, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and led to a well-received three-part NOVA special hosted by Greene in 2003. The Elegant Universe was re-released in 2010 with a new preface and epilogue.
