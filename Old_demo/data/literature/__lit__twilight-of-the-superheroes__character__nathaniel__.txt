Nathaniel is part of a new generation that faces a bright
				future with endless possibilities but is simultaneously filled with
				uncertainty. Although Nathaniel has yet to accomplish anything of
				significance so far, his life is full of potential. He has come
				to New York to access the cultured, artistic, and vibrant lifestyle
				his Uncle Lucien and Aunt Charlie embodied when they visited him
				as a child. However, his youth and inexperience coupled with the
				traumatic world events he has witnessed have stunted his personal
				growth and prevented him from maturing into full adulthood. After
				witnessing the World Trade Center collapse, he has lost his innocence
				without gaining an adult perspective on the world. He doesn’t idealize
				the world but hopes to passively create an authentic space for himself
				and his friends, as evidenced by the hero of his own comic strip,
				“Passivityman.” Like Passivityman, Nathaniel is trapped by the paradox
				of wanting to engage the world around him but also wanting to stay protected
				from it. Unlike Passivityman, however, Nathaniel actually does attempt
				to interact with others: he has a job, he has had a relationship
				with Delphine, and now he may need to find a place to live on his
				own. This final step will be an important test of Nathaniel’s promise
				and will offer him the chance to become fully independent.
