The Help, Kathryn Stockett’s 2009 debut novel, explores the 1960s Jim Crow South—not from a legal or political perspective, but from what occurs in the home between Black maids and the white women they work for. The #1 New York Times bestselling novel is told from the perspectives of two Black domestic workers and one white woman who decides to tell their story. In the end, all three discover how writing can tear down the racial barriers constructed by society. The Help was adapted into a major motion picture with the same title in 2011.
