White Teeth, a best-selling first novel by English author Zadie Smith published in 2001, is a family saga, an international thriller, a meditation on life, and a satire on immigration, racism, assimilation, sexism, youth culture, liberal education, and religion. Its themes are serious, but its tone is light. The narrator’s strong, distinctive voice is compassionate, wise, and witty, transporting the reader to a London immigrant community in the late 20th century, a complex world of clashing cultures and evolving identities. The critical and commercial success of White Teeth helped establish Smith as a leading contemporary writer.
