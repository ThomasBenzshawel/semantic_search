Audience members may well see Stanley as an egalitarian
hero at the play’s start. He is loyal to his friends and passionate
to his wife. Stanley possesses an animalistic physical vigor that
is evident in his love of work, of fighting, and of sex. His family
is from Poland, and several times he expresses his outrage
at being called “Polack” and other derogatory names. When Blanche
calls him a “Polack,” he makes her look old-fashioned and ignorant
by asserting that he was born in America, is an American, and can only
be called “Polish.” Stanley represents the new, heterogeneous America
to which Blanche doesn’t belong, because she is a relic from a defunct
social hierarchy. He sees himself as a social leveler, as he tells
Stella in Scene Eight.

	Stanley’s intense hatred of Blanche is motivated in part
by the aristocratic past Blanche represents. He also (rightly) sees
her as untrustworthy and does not appreciate the way she attempts
to fool him and his friends into thinking she is better than they
are. Stanley’s animosity toward Blanche manifests itself in all
of his actions toward her—his investigations of her past, his birthday
gift to her, his sabotage of her relationship with Mitch.

	In the end, Stanley’s down-to-earth character proves
harmfully crude and brutish. His chief amusements are gambling,
bowling, sex, and drinking, and he lacks ideals and imagination.
His disturbing, degenerate nature, first hinted at when he beats
his wife, is fully evident after he rapes his sister-in-law. Stanley
shows no remorse for his brutal actions. The play ends with an image
of Stanley as the ideal family man, comforting his wife as she holds
their newborn child. The wrongfulness of this representation, given
what we have learned about him in the play, ironically calls into
question society’s decision to ostracize Blanche.
