English author Neil Gaiman’s best-selling 2008 novel The Graveyard Book is a winner of the prestigious Newbery Medal for children’s literature. This book about a boy adopted by the supernatural occupants of a graveyard was written for young adults but is also popular with readers of Gaiman’s adult novels. The Graveyard Book has elements of both fantasy and horror, although the overall atmosphere of the story is more dreamlike and whimsical than frightening. The story takes its title from the setting, a graveyard, and the author has said it is an homage to Rudyard Kipling’s classic growing-up tale The Jungle Book.
