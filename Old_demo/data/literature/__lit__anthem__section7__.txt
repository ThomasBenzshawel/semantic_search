Equality 7-2521 wakes in the forest
					and realizes that for the first time in his life, he is waking because
					he is rested and not because someone is ringing a bell to wake him.
					He observes the forest in some detail, and it seems magnificent
					to him. He stretches his body out on the moss, and he laughs and
					laughs for no reason except that he is free. He realizes that he
					can stay asleep and lie on the moss as long as he wants. His body,
					of its own volition, jumps up and whirls around in a circle.

Equality 7-2521 takes his lightbulb
					and heads into the forest. The forest is dense, and as he works
					through the leaves, he compares the forest to the sea, thinking
					of the bushes as waves below him, spraying up into the treetops.
					When he is hungry, Equality 7-2521 stops
					and uses a single stone as an arrow to kill a bird. He cooks the bird
					and eats it. He finds great satisfaction in killing the bird and
					is surprised to find that he takes pride in eating.

Equality 7-2521 then comes to a
					stream, where he stops to drink. He sees his reflection for the
					first time, and it takes his breath away. He is frozen in front
					of the stream staring at his own image. He discovers he does not
					look like his brothers, because they are shapeless, formless, and
					downtrodden while he is thin, strong, and lithe. He is hard and
					strong and concludes that he can trust himself and has nothing to
					fear of his own company.

Equality 7-2521 has walked through
					the forest all day when he suddenly remembers that he is exiled
					from society, or, in his words, “Damned.” He laughs because he does
					not care that he is damned. It is the only time he thinks of what
					he has left behind. Equality 7-2521 tells
					us that he is writing on the same paper he used in the tunnel. He
					intends to write a great deal because he concludes he has a great
					deal to say to himself. At the moment, however, there is too much
					he does not understand to continue writing.

Equality 7-2521’s return to nature
					to escape the evils of man reflects Rand’s belief that only other
					men can limit the freedom of a man and that in the state of nature
					man is completely free. This theme is common in philosophy, especially
					in the work of eighteenth-century Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques
					Rousseau who, in his Confessions, suggests that
					man was a superior being before society and its constructs weakened
					his constitution. In Anthem, in the forest, where he
					has been forbidden by society to go, Equality 7-2521 experiences the
					joy of his body for the first time when he is not oppressed by work
					assigned to him by others and the yoke of collectivism. His legs
					return him to the state of nature instinctively because, for Rand, individualism
					constitutes a near-instinct, a feeling so ingrained in human make-up
					that it cannot be completely abolished and will be rediscovered,
					as Equality 7-2521 has rediscovered it, under
					even the most dire circumstances.

For Rand, physical beauty and athletic prowess accompany intellectual
					and moral perfection naturally, and the two combine in Equality 7-2521 to
					create what she considers an ideal man. Vanity and pride are both
					positive attributes in Rand’s thinking, which is why she relates
					the story of Equality 7-2521’s discovery
					of his own reflection with no irony. The incident closely resembles
					the story of Narcissus, the Greek mythological character who became
					so obsessed with his own reflection that he sat at the edge of a
					pool staring at it until he became a flower. Nevertheless, in Anthem, Equality 7-2521’s
					self-admiration is a form of self-discovery and liberation from
					social convention. Additionally, the episode of Equality 7-2521 feeding
					himself is a manifestation of his perfection. Though as a street
					sweeper Equality 7-2521 has never been hunting
					for birds before and has probably never cooked a bird before, he
					fells a bird with a single throw of a sharp rock, cooks the bird
					over a fire, and very much enjoys his meal because he is a perfect
					man, capable of succeeding in everything he tries, even when it
					is completely new to him. Rand often referred to herself as a Romantic,
					by which she meant that she was concerned chiefly with the ideal.
					Omitting details such as Equality 7-2521’s
					probable first ten tries to kill the bird is an example of her disregard
					for realistic detail in favor of imbuing her heroes with perfection
					befitting her ideal.

Equality 7-2521’s return to nature
					also signals Rand’s presentation of Equality 7-2521 as
					the new Adam, the creator of the true human race. Here, he is at
					one with nature and at peace with his body, and he has returned
					to Eden. In the biblical story of Genesis, Adam and Eve live in
					harmony in the Garden of Eden until a serpent tempts Eve with fruit
					from the tree of knowledge. When they eat the fruit, Adam and Eve
					become aware of their own bodies and selves. When God, who has forbidden
					them to eat of the tree of knowledge, discovers their sin, he throws
					them out of the garden and into the world, where they spawn a flawed
					race of men. The parallel is turned on its head here, however, by
					Equality 7-2521’s realization that he is,
					in fact, an outcast. For Rand, Eden is a place that can be re-entered
					by using knowledge itself. Ironically, it takes becoming an outcast
					for Equality 7-2521 to realize where he will
					be able to find happiness and self-awareness. For Rand, self-awareness
					is saving, not damning.

Technology and nature, often in tension in literature,
					are means to the same end in Anthem. Nature provides
					man a chance to prove himself, a way to make it on his own. It belongs
					to him because he is a man, and the natural order is such that the
					forest welcomes him into its keep. Technology, likewise, belongs
					to man because he has created it. He creates it because it is progress
					and it exalts him. Interestingly, the emphasis on nature in Anthem is
					not present in Rand’s other works, where the emphasis is chiefly
					on the city and man’s achievements. In Anthem, however,
					Rand emphasizes that man is the master of all creation, and that
					he can use his mind to master even those elements, such as lightning
					and electricity, that seem to master him. Indeed, Rand often suggests
					that the world is meaningless without man’s mind in it to give it
					meaning, and in this way, technology is the complement of nature
					because technology is essentially a natural force with the direction
					of man’s will behind it.
