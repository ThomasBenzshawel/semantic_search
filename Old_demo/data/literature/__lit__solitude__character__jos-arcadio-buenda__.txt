The founder and patriarch of Macondo, José Arcadio Buendía
				represents both great leadership and the innocence of the ancient world.
				He is a natural explorer, setting off into the wilderness first
				to found Macondo and then to find a route between Macondo and the outside
				world. In this tale of creation he is the Adam figure, whose quest
				for knowledge, mirrored in the intellectual pursuits of his descendants,
				eventually results in his family’s loss of innocence. José Arcadio
				Buendía pushes his family forward into modernity, preferring the
				confines of his laboratory to the sight of a real flying carpet that
				the gypsies have brought. By turning his back on this ancient magic
				in favor of his more modern scientific ideas, he hastens the end
				of Macondo’s Eden-like state.

	For José Arcadio Buendía, however, madness comes sooner
				than disillusionment. Immediately after he thinks he has discovered
				a means to create perpetual motion—a physical impossibility—he goes
				insane, convinced that the same day is repeating itself over and over
				again. In a sense, his purported discovery of perpetual motion achieves
				a kind of total knowledge that may be too deep for the human mind
				to withstand. Perpetual motion could only exist in a world without
				time, which, for José Arcadio Buendía, is what the world becomes
				and, in a sense, is what time throughout the novel becomes: past,
				present and future often overlap. This overlapping of time allows
				José Arcadio Buendía to appear to his descendants in the form of
				a ghost, so that his presence will always be felt in Macondo.
