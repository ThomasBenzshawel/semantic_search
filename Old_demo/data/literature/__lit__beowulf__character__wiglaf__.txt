Wiglaf, one of Beowulf’s kinsmen and thanes, is the only
				warrior brave enough to help the hero in his fight against the dragon.
				Wiglaf conforms perfectly to the heroic code in that he is willing
				to die attempting to defeat the opponent and, more importantly,
				to save his lord. In this regard, Wiglaf appears as a reflection
				of the young Beowulf in the first part of the story—a warrior who
				is strong, fearless, valiant, and loyal. He embodies Beowulf’s statement
				from the early scenes of the poem that it is always better to act
				than to grieve. Wiglaf thus represents the next generation of heroism
				and the future of the kingdom. His bravery and solid bearing provide
				the single glint of optimism in the final part of the story, which,
				for the most part, is dominated by a tone of despair at what the
				future holds.
