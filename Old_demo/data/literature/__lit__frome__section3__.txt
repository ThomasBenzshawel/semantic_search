Against the dark background of the kitchen
						she stood up tall and angular, one hand drawing a quilted counterpane
						to her flat breast, while the other held a lamp.	

As the dance ends, Ethan first hears and then sees Mattie
					emerge, but he shrinks back in the shadows to avoid initiating contact.
					The crowd thins out rapidly, and Mattie is left wondering what has
					kept Ethan from coming to meet her. As Mattie stands alone, Eady approaches,
					offering to take her for a ride in his father’s cutter (a light
					sleigh drawn by a horse). Ethan, still hanging back, observes Mattie
					seeming to waver, and wonders whether she will go with Eady or refuse
					his attentions. After unhitching the horse from its post and setting
					the cutter in motion, Eady confidently calls out to Mattie to hop
					in. She politely declines. When Eady attempts to pick her up by
					linking arms with her, she draws away gracefully. As Frome listens
					to the bells of the cutter fade away in the distance, he sees Mattie’s
					shadow walking alone up the hill toward the silent snow bank.

Ethan quickly closes in on Mattie, surprising her with
					his presence when he catches up to her amidst the Varnums’ spruce
					trees. She is genuinely caught off guard by his trick and lets out
					a peal of laughter that thrills Ethan. They link arms together and
					look at the “coasting hill,” where people go sledding. Ethan says
					they can sled there the following night if the moon is out. Mattie
					mentions that Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum, a young engaged couple,
					nearly collided with the big elm at the bottom of the hill when
					they were sledding. “We were all sure they were killed,” she says
					with a shudder.

Beginning the hike home, Ethan continues to wonder about
					Mattie’s feelings toward Eady and decides to press the issue by
					needling Mattie about her behavior at the dance. But his roundabout
					fashion of pursuing the conversation only leads Mattie to believe
					that Ethan’s wife, Zeena, is on the verge of dismissing her. Mattie
					wonders if Ethan himself is similarly inclined, although dismissal
					of Mattie is the furthest thing from Ethan’s mind. Left at an impasse, the
					couple drops the subject wordlessly, and Ethan and Mattie continue
					on their way.

At the Frome gate, Ethan attempts to reassure Mattie,
					and the companions then draw together as they ascend the hill. Ethan,
					meditating on the prospect of being with Mattie always, puts his
					arm decidedly around her for the first time. At the back door of
					the dark house, Ethan searches for the key that Zeena usually leaves
					out for them, but he finds nothing. When Ethan kneels down for a
					more thorough search, he spies a faint ray of light behind the door.
					The door then opens to reveal Zeena, a sickly, complaining woman. Zeena
					explains that she was unable to sleep on account of her poor health,
					and she brings her lamp around to the stairs to light the way up.
					Ethan declares that he will be staying downstairs for a while, as he
					has some accounts to review. When Zeena dismisses the idea as a foolish
					one, he submissively follows her and Mattie upstairs, retiring into
					the bedroom with his wife.

In Mattie, Ethan finds a somewhat mystical kinship—the
					text compares Ethan’s infatuation with his wife’s cousin to the
					“shock of silent joy” that he feels when he contemplates the beauties
					of nature. Given his sensitivity to place, it is no surprise that
					Ethan feels especially energized during his nighttime walks home
					from town with Mattie. During these moments, Ethan feels most strongly
					the “sweetness” of the connection between them.

Standing between Ethan and Mattie is the ailing Zeena,
					another character whom Wharton reveals only by hints and degrees.
					An early passage describes Zeena as having sharp and suspicious
					eyes, and although the conversation that Ethan remembers as he stands outside
					the church (summarized in the previous section) seems harmless,
					Zeena’s words resonate with hidden insight. For instance, when Zeena
					states to Ethan that the doctor thinks she shouldn’t be left alone,
					it seems that she is arguing the necessity of a housekeeper, but
					underlying this remark is Zeena’s sense that Ethan and Mattie could
					run off together. Just when we are sure that Zeena’s sole concern
					is the possibility of Mattie leaving, she makes a caustic remark about
					the fact that since Mattie’s arrival, Ethan has taken to shaving every
					day. This remark also seems to belie Zeena’s well-founded suspicion
					of an intrigue between her husband and her cousin, as does her evening
					vigil.

Wharton’s caricature-like depiction of Zeena makes her
					seem like an old woman who possesses neither beauty nor kindness.
					Juxtaposed with Mattie, Zeena serves as a foil (a character whose
					attitudes or emotions contrast with and thereby accentuate those
					of another character), highlighting Mattie’s vigor. Mattie seems
					to embody health, with her vibrant scarf and her last name, Silver, which
					suggests brightness. Zeena, on the other hand, speaks in a “flat
					whine,” and when she appears at the doorway to greet Ethan, Wharton
					dwells on her “flat breast,” “puckered throat,” and the “hollows
					and prominences” of her face. The contest for Ethan’s heart is no
					contest at all—Mattie seems to be Ethan’s soul-mate, Zeena a nagging,
					hypochondriacal shrew.

Because the reader already knows, by the time the narrator
					meets Ethan, that Ethan is disfigured, a mood of foreboding hangs
					over the story. The “throng of disregarded hints and menaces” that
					crowd Ethan’s mind at the dance foreshadows the impending danger.
					The conversation about the sledding hill, with its mention of the
					potentially deadly elm, also constitutes a deliberate and obvious
					foreshadowing of later events.
