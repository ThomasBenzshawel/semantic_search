Sam’s remarkable heroism in Book VI consists of courageous
				action that is tempered by love and spontaneity. Aragorn and the
				Riders of Rohan fight without restraint, as though they have always
				done so and know little else. As a Hobbit, Sam tends merely to stumble
				into adventurous deeds, and his plodding pursuit to save Frodo echoes with
				the running self-commentary Sam performs in his head. We do not
				just watch Sam run through the gates of Cirith Ungol brandishing
				the phial of Galadriel; we hear Sam prepare himself and see him shrug
				his shoulders and fumble absentmindedly for the magic phial. We
				know that Sam is not really an imposing Elf-warrior, as the Ring’s
				power causes the Orcs to see him. Instead, we see the Orcs from
				Sam’s perspective, sharing his dismay when they turn to run from
				him in fear. Sam offers a model of the hero whose heroism lies not
				in impulse, but in the choices he constantly and consciously makes
				to perform heroic deeds. Sam’s heroism is comical, for he is consistently
				surprised by his success.

Sam’s playfulness as a surprised hero is tempered by his
				genuine devotion to Frodo. All heroes must have first principles—the -inspiration
				of their actions. Sam possesses such a strong tacit love for Frodo
				that he becomes united with the object of his service. As Sam climbs
				Mount Doom, carrying Frodo, the comrades appear to be only one hobbit
				climbing, not two. The ascent of Mount Doom is emblematic of Sam’s
				friendship with Frodo. Sam’s sacrifice produces true friendship,
				for he loses all thoughts of himself in his devoted care for his
				companion and master.
