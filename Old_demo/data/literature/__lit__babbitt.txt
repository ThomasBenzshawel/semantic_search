Babbitt, published in 1922 by American author Sinclair Lewis, is a satirical novel that follows the life of George F. Babbitt, a middle-aged real estate broker living in the fictional midwestern city of Zenith. Babbitt is a staunch conformist who is deeply dissatisfied with his life but is unwilling, in the end, to challenge the status quo. The novel is a critique of American middle-class values and the conformity and materialism that Lewis believed defined post–World War I culture in the United States.
