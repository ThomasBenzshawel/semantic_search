Mr. Wormwood is Matildaâ€™s father and the secondary antagonist in the story. He is a deceitful, dishonest used car salesman and a neglectful father. He hates books and learning and seems opposed to education of any sort. He brags about the way he swindles people into buying his cars and is proud of how he puts sawdust in the gas tanks and turns back the odometers. He is mean and even cruel to Matilda, but she gets her revenge through the various pranks she pulls on him. He, however, is not a quick study, because he does not learn his lesson. At the end, his underhanded and deceitful ways catch up with him when he and his family are forced to flee the country. He has no problem leaving Matilda behind, and she has no desire to go with him.
