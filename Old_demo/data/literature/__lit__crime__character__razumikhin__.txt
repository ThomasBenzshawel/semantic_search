Raskolnikov’s college friend Razumikhin serves as a foil for Raskolnikov, a bright light to Raskolnikov’s gloomy shadow. Razumikhin’s completely opposite character from Raskolnikov can be read as commentary on the argument that all crime stems from circumstance, a stance floated at one of Razumikhin’s parties. Both are impoverished students, but unlike Raskolnikov, Razumikhin loves other people. He constantly throws parties, is eager to help Raskolnikov with his debts, and even tries to clear the innocent painter Nikolai of the pawnbroker’s murder simply out of goodness. He has a strong sense of morality and sees the best in people to the point where Raskolnikov’s article shocks him. His worst behavior, a fit of jealousy over Dunya’s engagement, greatly shames him in a manner almost comical when compared to Raskolnikov’s torment over his own crime. At first glance, Razumikhin’s staunch goodness may make him seem less intelligent than Raskolnikov. However, his last name derives from the Russian word razum which means reason or intelligence. The combination of his name and morality suggests that true reason in Crime and Punishment comes from a more traditional idea of goodness, in sharp contrast to Raskolnikov’s dreams of an amoral superman.
