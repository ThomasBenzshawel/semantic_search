James Jarvis undergoes a journey parallel to that of Kumalo, although
				he is never granted the chance to be reunited with his son, Arthur,
				physically. Jarvis is a white, English-speaking farmer who lives
				on a hill above Ndotsheni. When the novel begins, Jarvis is ignorant
				of or indifferent to the injustices of South Africa. He cares for
				his farm and his family, and he more or less takes for granted the political
				system in which he lives. Jarvis’s complacency is shattered when
				he learns that his son has been killed. He goes to stay with his son’s
				in-laws, the Harrisons, in Johannesburg, where he learns that Arthur
				had become a leader in the community, valued by people from all
				racial groups for his speeches on social justice. Jarvis here realizes
				that his son had become a stranger to him.

In an effort to understand his son better, Jarvis reads
				Arthur’s writings about the injustices he perceives in South Africa,
				and he is moved by his son’s language and ideas. Jarvis does not
				undergo a political conversion so much as a moral one—he is not
				interested, for example, by John Kumalo’s speech before the strike
				at the mines. Once he returns to Ndotsheni, however, he works hard
				to make things better for the people of the village. He donates
				milk to the young children and arranges to have a dam built to irrigate
				the soil better. Additionally, he hires an agricultural expert to
				teach the farmers to preserve the soil. When he suffers from a second
				tragedy—the death of his wife—he consoles himself by carrying out
				his wife’s wish that he build a new church for the community. Jarvis’s efforts
				require personal sacrifices, as it costs him both money and the
				respect of many of his peers. It is clear, however, that he has
				made a firm commitment to the villagers, and, though he is a man
				of few words, he expresses himself beautifully through his actions.
