The only female character in The Alchemist to get a modicum
				of attention, Fatima is defined by her beauty and her willingness to wait for
				Santiago while he pursues his Personal Legend. She lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,
				where her primary duty in life consists of gathering water from the local well, and
				she says as a woman of the desert she realizes that men must leave the women they
				love for long periods. When Santiago hesitates to leave Fatima and the oasis, she
				convinces him he must go. She has confidence that he will return if he loves her.
				Fatima says her ultimate goal is to love Santiago, and she appears to have no
				Personal Legend of her own.
