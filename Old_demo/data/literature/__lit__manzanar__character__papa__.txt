Papa, one of the most complex characters in Farewell
					to Manzanar, is the only character besides Jeanne whose
				development we see from beginning to end. Wakatsuki uses the character
				of Papa to explore one of the principal themes of her work: the
				danger of judging an individual by ethnicity alone. Jeanne’s own
				story addresses this theme as well, but Papa’s experiences give
				us a different and more tragic view of its significance. Jeanne
				is Japanese by heritage but American by birth, so she really belongs
				to both Japan and America. Papa, on the other hand, chose to leave
				his homeland to become a noncitizen in the United States, so in
				a sense, he belongs nowhere. He has virtually ceased to exist in
				Japan, where his family buried his memory nine years after his departure.
				On the other hand, as a noncitizen in the United States he is one
				of the lowest people in the social order. The only things he has
				to hold on to are his family, business, house, and pride in having
				made something of himself in the United States despite the odds
				stacked against him. His imprisonment, together with the charge
				of disloyalty leveled at him at Fort Lincoln, strips him of his
				possessions, tears his family apart, and worst of all, turns his
				pride into bitterness and anger. He is a tragic figure,
				and one of the reasons that Wakatsuki rarely places blame in her
				memoir is that she prefers to discuss the injustice of the internment
				by showing the extent to which it destroyed the loving man that
				was once her father.
