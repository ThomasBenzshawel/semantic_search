Erin Morgenstern's debut novel, The Night Circus, began as part of the popular writing challenge, National Novel Writing Month. Published in 2011, the novel tells the love story of Celia and Marco, who are pitted against one another in an ancient, magical challenge that shapes their entire lives. A novel told from multiple viewpoints, The Night Circus blurs fantasy and reality as it explores the magical world of a turn-of-the-century circus and the lives caught up in its orbit.
