Tommy is part of the popular crowd, but he does not allow the group’s opinions to dictate his actions or his opinion of himself. He has a firm grasp of the fact that the social mores of high school, and high school itself, are not very important at all. This awareness does not, however, lead to dismissiveness on his part. He gets good grades, excels in sports, and treats Sue with a loving respect that indicates her importance to him.

Tommy is perhaps the character who is most honest with himself, and he does not second guess his private thoughts. He is immediately struck by a beauty in Carrie that others do not see, and he does not allow any humor that others might perceive in the situation to prevent him from keeping his promise to Sue and asking Carrie to prom. His commitment to making Carrie’s evening magical shows that he is respectful of women, and his realization that he is in love with Carrie as well as Sue does not disturb him.
