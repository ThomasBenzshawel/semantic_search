When Candide fails to find Cunégonde and Cacambo after
					several months in Venice, he falls into despair. He begins to agree
					with Martin’s claim that the world is misery. Martin scolds Candide
					for trusting a valet with a fortune of millions, and repeats his
					argument that there is “little virtue and little happiness on the
					earth.”

	On the street, Candide sees a pretty young woman and
					a young monk walking arm-in-arm with happy expressions on their
					faces. When he approaches them, he discovers that the girl is Paquette
					and the monk is named Brother Giroflée. Paquette, Pangloss’s old
					mistress, confirms Pangloss’s story that he caught syphilis from
					her. A surgeon took pity on Paquette and cured her, and in return
					she became the surgeon’s mistress. The surgeon’s jealous wife beat Paquette
					every day, but the surgeon tired of his wife and poisoned her while
					treating her for a common cold. His wife’s family sued him, so he
					fled. Paquette was sent to prison but the judge granted her freedom
					on the condition that she become his mistress. When the judge tired
					of Paquette he turned her out, and she resorted to prostitution.
					Brother Giroflée is one of her clients, and Paquette appears happy
					to please him. Giroflée’s parents have forced him into the monastery
					to increase his older brother’s fortune. Giroflée hates the monastery
					because it is rife with petty intrigue. Candide gives the two money
					to ease their sorrows.

Candide visits Count Pococurante in Venice. The wealthy
					count has a marvelous collection of art and books, but he is unable
					to enjoy any of it. He finds the paintings of Raphael unpleasant
					and the works of Homer, Horace, and Milton tiresome. The count once
					pretended to appreciate these things in front of others, but is
					now unable to pretend, and scorns those who “admire everything in
					a well-known author.” The count’s brashness astonishes Candide, who
					has never been trained to judge for himself, but Martin finds the
					count’s remarks reasonable. Candide thinks the count must be a genius
					because nothing pleases him. Martin explains that there is “some
					pleasure in having no pleasure.”

During Venice’s Carnival season, Candide and Martin are
					dining with six strangers in an inn when they encounter Cacambo,
					who is now the slave of one of the six strangers. Cacambo explains
					that Cunégonde is in Constantinople and offers to bring Candide
					to her. Summoned by his master, he is unable to say any more. Candide
					and Martin converse with their dinner companions and discover that each
					is a deposed king from a different corner of Europe. One of them,
					Theodore of Corsica, is the poorest and least fortunate, and the
					others each offer him twenty sequins. Candide gives him a diamond
					worth one hundred times that sum. The kings wonder about his identity
					and the sources of his generosity.

Martin’s reaction to Candide’s despair at not finding
					Cunégonde reveals the drawback of his pessimism. Instead of attempting
					to comfort or even distract his friend and benefactor, Martin gloats over
					Candide’s distress to further confirm his own world-view. Like Pangloss’s
					unqualified optimism, Martin’s unqualified pessimism keeps him from
					taking active steps to improve the world.

	Still, that pessimism is further confirmed by the story
					of Giroflée and Paquette, an apparently blissful young couple whose
					idyllic appearance masks misfortunes much like those every other
					character has encountered. Martin warns Candide that throwing money
					at their problems will not erase them, a warning that bears fruit
					in the remaining chapters. After all, Candide’s wealth has multiplied
					his problems rather than eliminated them.

	The count, who seems to have everything, is still unhappy.
					He has wealth, education, art, and literature at his command, but
					none of it truly pleases him. Candide, who had the pleasure of utopia
					in Eldorado, returned to the imperfect world because he wanted to find
					Cunégonde and enjoy resources such as those the count has but fails
					to enjoy. Through the count, who only takes pleasure in constant
					criticism of everything, Voltaire perhaps means to suggest that human
					beings are incapable of satisfaction.

	In some ways, the count embodies Enlightenment attitudes.
					The thinkers of that era had access to a greater wealth of art and
					learning than those of most previous eras of European civilization.
					The work of the Renaissance artist Raphael and the Greek and Roman authors
					on the count’s bookshelf were important staples of the culture of
					that period. Yet Enlightenment thinkers were famous for biting criticism.
					The count voices support for the practice of seeking knowledge and
					experience before making judgments. He scorns people who judge a
					writer by his reputation rather than by his work. The emphasis on
					gaining knowledge through experience is strongly characteristic
					of Voltaire’s own thinking. Thus, it is probable that Voltaire is
					in some ways sympathetic to the count’s critical point of view.
					The count’s discernment certainly seems preferable to Candide’s
					mindless reverence for the authors he has been taught to regard
					as good. At the same time, the count’s character illustrates Voltaire’s
					skepticism at the idea that anything, even great art, can make human
					beings happy.

	The six strangers, who claim to be dethroned kings, serve
					as an extended mockery of the arrogance of the aristocracy. Although they
					believe they are naturally endowed with the right to power, they
					continually lose power through wars and political upheaval. Candide
					feels sorry for the strangers, but Martin correctly states in Chapter 27 that
					their sufferings are nothing to shed tears over. The strangers still
					have valets and slaves at their disposal. One of them even owns
					Cacambo, Candide’s good friend.

	The account of the dethroned kings also illustrates the
					changes that were taking place in Voltaire’s society. The growth
					of capitalism meant that the European nobility was losing influence
					to commoners who made or acquired wealth of their own accord. The
					kings wonder at the fact that Candide, a private citizen, has far
					more money than they do. Voltaire, who was not of noble birth but
					had a vast fortune, himself lent or gave money to impoverished royals.
					In this context, the overweening pride of the aristocracy seems
					not merely unjust but completely unjustified.
