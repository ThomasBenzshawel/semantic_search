A Small Place is a work of creative nonfiction by Antiguan-American novelist and essayist Jamaica Kincaid that was first published in 1988. Taking the form of an extended essay, the work is in parts a memoir about growing up in Antigua, denunciations of the Caribbean nation’s government and Britain’s colonial legacy, and a condemation of the tourist industry. Reactions to A Small Place upon its publication ranged from praise for its perceived heartfelt authenticity to sharp criticisms by those who believed it to be an unfair and unwarranted attack on Antigua’s people and government. Kincaid has said that she feared returning to Antigua for several years after the publication of A Small Place due to fears over potentially violent reprisals.
