Always referring to himself as “we,” a youth named Equality 7-2521 writes
					in a journal from underground, where he is alone in an abandoned
					railroad tunnel. He and his friend International 4-8818 discovered
					the tunnel when they were working as street sweepers behind the
					theater near the edge of the unnamed city where they live. Equality 7-2521,
					ignoring International 4-8818’s objections
					that it is forbidden because the Council has not allowed it, goes
					down into the tunnel to explore. He concludes that the tunnel must
					have been built by men during the Unmentionable Times of long ago,
					and it must therefore be an evil place. Nonetheless, he is drawn
					to the train tracks that he finds there, and when he reemerges from
					the hole, he makes International 4-8818 promise
					not to tell anyone about the hole. International 4-8818,
					an artist who is strong and funny, is very upset by this idea because
					it might be forbidden, but out of a sense of loyalty to Equality 7-2521,
					he agrees, though even the sense of loyalty that he feels upsets
					him because preference of one person over another is not permitted
					by the Council.

After he finds the tunnel, Equality 7-2521 returns
					to it each night by sneaking away from the group home where he lives
					when the others all go to the theater for the nightly show. He has
					stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers and manuscripts
					from the Home of the Scholars. He writes and thinks alone in the
					tunnel. He acknowledges that his being alone is evil, considering
					the desire to be alone a part of his curse, but he feels no shame
					or regret about it. He very much enjoys talking to himself and for
					his own ears, even though he has been taught that it is evil to
					do anything for oneself. He knows that if he is discovered he will
					be punished harshly.

Equality 7-2521 describes his childhood
					at the Home for Infants, where he lived with all the other boys
					of his age, in a white room with a hundred beds and nothing else
					in it. At the age of five, he moved to the Home of the Students,
					where he lived until he was fifteen. He was a troublesome child
					because he often fought with the other boys who lived there. His
					teachers disliked him because he was too smart, and the authorities
					chastised him because he was taller than the others. He tried to
					be like the other children, but his curse kept him from achieving
					normalcy. He especially tried to be like Union 5-3992,
					a dull and stupid boy in his class. His curse made him curious and
					pushed him to ask questions, which his teachers eventually forbade.

When he turned fifteen, Equality 7-2521,
					like all the other boys, was assigned his task for the remainder
					of his life by the Council of Vocations. Equality 7-2521 desperately
					wanted to be assigned to the Home of the Scholars, who develop all
					technology for the society, including the candle, the most recent
					invention, discovered a century earlier. He wanted to be a scholar
					more than anything, even more than being a leader, a status considered
					a great honor in his society, allowing those so assigned to live
					in the Home of the Leaders, the largest building in the city. Equality 7-2521 sinned
					by wanting, however, and he was pleased to be able to make restitution
					for his sin by embracing his assigned profession—street sweeper.

In the tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records
					in his journal how he had lived at the Home of the Street Sweepers
					for four years, leading the highly structured life of a street sweeper,
					when he discovered the tunnel with International 4-8818 and
					began writing his journal.

Equality 7-2521 is Rand’s prophet,
					in the sense that he rejects all the collectivism that has come
					before him and ushers in a new age of individualism. His society
					rejects him because he is superior to it, both intellectually and
					physically, and, most important for Rand, in his belief that the
					self is important. A few are drawn to his superiority, in spite
					of the masses’ scorn. International 4-8818,
					though he cannot comprehend why he feels such tremendous loyalty
					to his friend, is nevertheless compelled to stand by him, in defiance of everything
					his society has taught him. In this way, International 4-8818 operates
					as Equality 7-2521’s disciple, following
					him and believing him, even though he does not understand why he does so. Moreover,
					we are alerted to the importance of International 4-8818’s
					devotion through the use of dialogue, a rare occurrence in the novella.

The comparison between Equality 7-2521 and
					traditional Judeo-Christian prophets is far from perfect, however.
					Although the language and the plot of the novella contain countless
					references to allegories from the lives of Christ and Moses and
					the story of Genesis, Equality 7-2521 does
					not reference a higher being and does not claim to come in the name
					of the higher power. Instead of worshipping a god of any kind, Equality 7-2521 worships
					himself. On the other hand, Equality 7-2521 is
					similar to other prophets in the sense that everything that came
					before is modified in light of the message he bears. Though he has
					been taught to believe that being alone and worshipping the self
					are sins, he feels no regret about doing these things because he
					believes them to be right, which is more important to him than anything
					society can teach him.

Although Rand makes many allusions to actual historical
					details about life in Soviet Russia, Anthem is
					removed from any particular historical setting and placed in a kind
					of every-country, an unnamed future world in which individual needs
					are ignored in favor of the common good. Thus, the references to
					the Councils and to the nightly meetings at the City Theatre bear
					close resemblance to the state of affairs in the Soviet Union in
					the early twentieth century, but the total regression of all technology
					is an exaggeration that is not grounded in historical fact. By separating
					the novella from the Soviet Union, Rand makes the story a warning
					to all people. The novella does not just announce the dangers of
					adopting Russian socialism, under which many people blamed specific
					corruptions for the atrocities that were committed in the name of
					the common good. It also blames the very idea of collectivism for
					the demise of the human race. Rand believes that this destruction
					is inevitable where men come to believe in social planning, not
					just in the case of the specific evils of communist Russia. Although Anthem certainly makes
					reference to the problems plaguing Russia at the time of its publication,
					the work is more than just an invective against Lenin, who inaugurated
					the communist era in Russia, or Stalin, who carried out horrifying
					purges against the intellectual elite in the name of the good of
					the many.

In the opening chapter, Rand sets up the images that occur throughout
					the novella to draw our attention to the values she is promoting.
					The most important element of this imagery is the contrasted pairs
					she sets up. These pairings point us toward the characters and scenarios
					she believes are good and those she believes are evil. For example,
					the dark and dingy tunnel is lit by a candle but Equality 7-2521 prefers
					it to the pristine white of the homes in which he has lived with
					all his fellow infants, students, and street sweepers. Additionally,
					the villains of the novella are soft, featureless, and dead-seeming,
					like the members of the Council of Vocations, while the hero and
					later the heroine are hard and strong and vibrant. Indeed, in most
					cases, Rand turns traditional images on their heads by making the
					dark and hard preferable to the light and gentle.

The worst part of the collective society for Rand is its
					bland -obliteration of all individual characteristics and features.
					Thus, Equality 7-2521, the hero, is taller
					than his compatriots, and International 4-8818,
					who is also a good character, stands apart from his fellows because
					he has laughter in his eyes. These features mark the good characters,
					while the villains are indistinguishable from one another. Indeed,
					throughout the story, the physical world closely models the internal
					world, and what is good can be seen as good from the outside as
					well as from what Rand reveals of the inside.
