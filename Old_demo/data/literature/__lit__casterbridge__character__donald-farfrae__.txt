Farfrae, the young Scotchman, serves as a foil (a character
				whose actions or emotions contrast with and thereby accentuate those
				of another character) for Henchard. Whereas will and intuition determine
				the course of Henchard’s life, Farfrae is a man of intellect. He brings
				to Casterbridge a method for salvaging damaged grain, a system for
				reorganizing and revolutionizing the mayor’s business, and a blend
				of curiosity and ambition that enables him to take interest in—and
				advantage of—the agricultural advancements of the day (such as the
				seed-sowing machine).

Although Henchard soon comes to view Farfrae as his adversary, the
				Scotchman’s victories are won more in the name of progress than
				personal satisfaction. His primary motive in taking over Casterbridge’s
				grain trade is to make it more prosperous and prepare the village
				for the advancing agricultural economy of the later nineteenth century.
				He does not intend to dishonor Henchard. Indeed, even when Henchard
				is at his most adversarial—during his fight with Farfrae in the
				barn, for instance—the Scotchman reminds himself of the fallen mayor’s
				circumstances, taking pains to understand and excuse Henchard’s
				behavior. In his calm, measured thinking, Farfrae is a model man
				of science, and Hardy depicts him with the stereotypical strengths
				and weaknesses of such people. He possesses an intellectual competence
				so unrivaled that it passes for charisma, but throughout the novel
				he remains emotionally distant. Although he wins the favor of the
				townspeople with his highly successful day of celebration, Farfrae
				fails to feel any emotion too deeply, whether it is happiness inspired
				by his carnival or sorrow at the death of his wife. In this respect
				as well he stands in bold contrast to Henchard, whose depth of feeling
				is so profound that it ultimately dooms him.
