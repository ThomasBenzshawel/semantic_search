Kino’s wife, Juana, is more reflective and more practical
				than Kino. She prays for divine aid when Coyotito’s wound leaves
				Kino impotent with rage, and she also has the presence of mind to
				salve the wound with a seaweed poultice. Juana is loyal and submissive, obeying
				her husband as her culture dictates, but she does not always agree
				with his actions. Like Kino, Juana is at first seduced by the greed
				the pearl awakens, but she is much quicker than Kino to recognize
				the pearl as a potential threat. In fact, Juana comes to view the
				pearl as a symbol of evil.

As the novella progresses, Juana becomes certain that
				the limitations, rules, and customs of her society must be upheld.
				Whereas Kino seeks to transform his existence, Juana believes that
				their lives will be better if they keep things as they are. Kino
				can see only what they have to gain from the pearl, but Juana can
				see also what they stand to lose, and she wisely prefers to protect
				what she has rather than sacrifice it all for a dream. Juana thus
				serves an important function in the novella—she counterbalances
				Kino’s enthusiasm and reminds the reader that Kino’s desire to make
				money is dangerous. Juana also symbolizes the family’s domestic
				happiness; the scene in which Kino beats her for trying to cast
				off the pearl thus represents Kino’s tragic break from the family
				he longs to support.
