Zverkov is a prime example of the kind of man the Underground Man
hates most, “l’homme de la nature et de la vérité.”
Zverkov is an active and decisive man, preferring to pursue concrete
goals rather than contemplate the value of those goals in modern
society. He has been very successful, having advanced far in his
career, seduced numerous women, and gained the admiration of his
friends and acquaintances. In school, the Underground Man hated
Zverkov for his stupidity and boastfulness, and resented him for
his wealth, good looks, and popularity. The Underground Man explains
that Zverkov was popular because he was “favored with the gifts
of nature”—his social success was rather Darwinian. By the 1840s, Zverkov
is much the same as he was in school, except a little fatter, probably
because of his hearty enjoyment of food along with wine and women.
The Underground Man feels that Zverkov treats him with condescension.
The Underground Man is right, but Zverkov at least attempts to treat
him politely. We see Zverkov, as we see all of the other characters
in the novel, only through the eyes of the Underground Man. It is
difficult, therefore, to get an objective view of Zverkov’s real
personality. The Underground Man describes Zverkov as a coarse,
mincing, piggish idiot, but we can also see that Zverkov is amiable
and generous with his friends. His rudeness to the Underground Man
can be explained at least partially by the Underground Man’s aggressive
behavior.
