Rosamond is the most genteel character in Middlemarch.
				Her interests are not serious; she is concerned with social niceties,
				upward mobility, and living well. While Dorothea is beautiful, Rosamond
				is stunning and swanlike, a model of perfection. Although Rosamond comes
				from a middle-class background, her education lifts her to a higher
				social circle. She represents the ability to change social status through
				conduct, but in the end her education ruins her marriage and happiness.

Rosamondâ€™s primary motivation is social advancement, which fuels
				her desire to wed Dr. Lydgate. Initially Rosamond seems to genuinely
				love Lydgate, but when he loses his money, Rosamond loses interest
				in him. Their marriage fails as Rosamond struggles to keep her house
				and her possessions and becomes petulant and manipulative in the
				process.
