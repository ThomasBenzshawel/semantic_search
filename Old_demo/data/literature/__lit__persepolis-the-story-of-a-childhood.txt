Persepolis is a collection of autobiographical comics about the life of Marjane Satrapi before and after the Iranian Revolution. Originally published as the first two parts of a four-part series in France between 2000–2003, Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood follows in the footsteps of the influential graphic novel Maus by using the format to depict and discuss serious historical events. Significantly, Persepolis is narrated by a woman whose perspective on the repressive Iranian regime is informed by her own persecution. It adapted into a film of the same name in 2007.
