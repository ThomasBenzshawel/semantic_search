Candide is the protagonist of the novel, but
				he is bland, naïve, and highly susceptible to the influence of stronger
				characters. Like the other characters, Candide is less a realistic
				individual  than the embodiment of a particular idea or folly that
				Voltaire wishes to illustrate.

Candide’s name is derived from the Latin word candidus, which means
				“white” and connotes fair-mindedness or a lack of corruption. As
				that name suggests, Candide begins the novel as a perfect innocent—wide-eyed
				in his worship of his tutor Pangloss’s wrongheaded optimistic philosophy,
				and completely unfamiliar with the ways of the world. Over the course
				of the novel, Candide acquires wealth and even some knowledge about
				the world, and begins to question his faith in optimism. Yet that
				faith remains and is frequently reactivated by any event that pleases
				him, from the kindness of the stranger Jacques to the death of Vanderdendur,
				the merchant who cheats him. At the end of the novel, Candide rejects
				Pangloss’s philosophizing in favor of the practical labor that is
				introduced to him by the old farmer. While this shift in philosophy
				appears on the surface to be real progress, Candide’s personality
				remains essentially unchanged. He is still incapable of forming
				his own opinions, and has simply exchanged blind faith in Pangloss’s
				opinions for blind faith in the opinions of the farmer. Despite
				his simplicity, Candide is an effective, sympathetic hero. He is
				fundamentally honest and good-hearted. He readily gives money to
				strangers like Brother Giroflée and the poorest deposed king, and
				he honors his commitment to marry Cunégonde even after his love
				for her has faded. His naïveté, though incredible, makes Candide
				sympathetic to readers; the world of the novel is exaggerated and
				fantastic, and we are likely to find the events described as unsettling
				and confusing as he does.
