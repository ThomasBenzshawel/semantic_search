Rand has little sympathy for the rise and fall of Peter
				Keating. Keating starts off as a young and attractive architecture
				student, and although he is clearly Roark’s inferior, their lives
				and careers advance in parallel fashion. By the novel’s end, however,
				Keating is a weak and alcoholic nobody, the exact fate once reserved
				for talented men like Henry Cameron. Whereas Cameron suffers because of
				others, however, Keating is a victim of his own mistakes. Unlike Wynand,
				who suffers for turning his back on his own potential, Keating is
				born mediocre and weak and never had a chance at greatness. Instead,
				Keating suffers for denying his own mediocrity and for thinking
				himself too good for a modest but happy life. In The Fountainhead, character
				determines fate, and the moment Keating becomes dishonest as well
				as weak, he dooms himself to unhappiness.
