Clarissa’s character is closely based on the title character
				of Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs. Dalloway. Like the
				character in Woolf’s book, she has a wondrous outlook toward the
				world around her. Though she takes great pleasure in the day-to-day
				details of life, she questions the choices that she has made and
				has doubts about what her life has come to. She has strong feelings
				of nostalgia for her love affair with Richard and the sense of unchecked
				possibility that she had in her youth. Clarissa compares this period
				of wild, unabashed freedom to the domesticity of her present life.
				She loves the small domestic details of her life, and she enjoys
				the simple acts of buying flowers and keeping a beautiful apartment.
				At the same time, she wonders if all of it is enough and has doubts
				about whether she feels fulfilled by her life and her relationship
				with Sally. Even though she questions some of her choices, at the
				end of the day she takes comfort in the idea that the life has meaning
				because of those hours that are filled with supreme, wonderful pleasure.
