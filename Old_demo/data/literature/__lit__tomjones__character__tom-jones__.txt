Tom Jones, Fielding's imperfect and "mortal" hero, is the character through
				whom Fielding gives voice to his philosophy of Virtue. In contrast to the moral
				philosophizing of many of Fielding's contemporaries, Fielding does not suggest
				that Tom's affairs with Molly Seagrim, Mrs. Waters, and Lady
				Bellaston should reflect badly on his character. Rather, keeping with the
				Romantic genre, Fielding seems to admire Tom's adherence to the principles of
				Gallantry, which require that a man return the interest of a woman.
				Interestingly, all of Tom's love affairs, including his relationship with
				Sophia, his true love, are initiated by the woman in question, which is
				Fielding's way of excusing Tom from the charge of lustful depravity.

Moreover, the fact that Tom's lovers include a feisty, unfeminine wench and two
				middle-aged women suggest that his motives are various. Tom also treats women
				with the utmost respect, obliging their desire to be courted by pretending to be
				the seducer even when they are seducing him. Tom refuses to abandon Molly for
				Sophia and is plagued by his obligations to Lady Bellaston. Nonetheless, Tom's
				refusal of the tempting marriage proposal of Arabella Hunt—whose last
				name underscores the fact that Tom is hunted more often than he is the
				hunter—indicates that he has mended his wild ways and is ready to become
				Sophia's husband. Tom's gallantry reveals itself in his relationships with men
				as well as women, however. This spirit is evident in Tom's insistence on paying
				the drinking bill for the army men at Bristol, and in his gallant defense of
				himself in the duel.
