The hard work of building and partially populating the city completed,
				Justice comes to sanctify the proceedings. She represents herself as the
				daughter of God, a direct descendant and representative. In this sense, the City
				of Ladies and Christine’s project are being given a final divine endorsement and
				blessing. By completing the roofs of the city, Justice symbolically links the
				community of women directly to the kingdom of Heaven. There is a direct
				correlation established in conjoining two metaphorical, abstract realms. In
				addition, Justice’s tales assume a darker, more violent character representing
				women’s bodies as the target of severe physical abuse and degradation. But the
				extremity of the aggressor’s actions toward these women is met with retribution
				that is equally cruel and forbidding. For their sin and idolatry, men are burned
				to ash and set to consuming their own flesh. Justice represents the darker side
				of divine love and the unyielding judgment that is meted out to those whose
				perversions and propensity for sin win out over their capacity for love,
				acceptance, and forgiveness. Justice’s presence serves as an absolute if not
				terrifying reminder of the fate awaiting those ruled by their cruelty and
				misogynistic acts.
