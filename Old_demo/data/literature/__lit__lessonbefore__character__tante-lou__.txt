Tante Lou is slightly subdued and seldom reveals her thoughts
				to Grant. Even by the end of the novel, we do not truly understand
				her. Her occasional remarks reveal her to be a spiritual woman,
				motivated by a powerful faith in God and in his good works. Because
				of her faith, Tante Lou has the hope and resilience Grant lacks,
				and she disapproves of Grant’s cynical brand of atheism. She exudes
				a sense of dignity despite her position in society; she and Miss
				Emma dress respectably and insist upon being chauffeured in the
				backseat to the Pichots. Tante Lou refuses to accept the idea that
				she must despair just because blacks in the South remain on the
				bottom rung of the economic ladder. Tante Lou is a positive force
				in Grant’s life and in the community. In some ways, she is responsible
				for Grant’s evolution. She demands that he behave with compassion
				and bravery, nagging him to help Jefferson and insisting that he
				speak with the Pichots in order to gain visitation rights at the
				prison.
