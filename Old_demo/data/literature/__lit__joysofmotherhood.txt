The Joys of Motherhood is a novel written by the UK-based Nigerian author Buchi Emecheta that was first published in 1979. Partly based on the experiences of Emecheta’s mother, this feminist literary classic is the story of Nnu Ego, a Nigerian woman struggling in a patriarchal society. Unable to conceive in her first marriage, Nnu is banished to Lagos where she succeeds in becoming a mother. Nnu must then protect herself and her children when she is abandoned by her husband and her people.
