Uncle Jewiir, who is Salva’s father’s younger brother, joins the group of refugees Salva is traveling with. He is the only link Salva has to his family. A former member of the Sudanese military, the refugees respect Uncle, and look to him for leadership. He becomes a father figure to Salva, protecting and caring for him on their journey to find a safe refugee camp. After Marial’s disappearance, Salva “clung to Uncle like a baby or a little boy … if it hadn’t been for Uncle, Salva might have gone crazy with fear.” Salva relies on Uncle’s steady, confident presence to face down the terror he feels “inside and out.” After Uncle is viciously killed by Nuer tribesmen, Salva leans on the memory of Uncle’s calm leadership and encouragement for the inspiration he needs to keep going. Uncle teaches Salva what will come to be the most valuable lesson of his journey: take “one step at a time.” Uncle had encouraged Salva with this advice at a moment when Salva was on the edge of despair, and Salva remembers Uncle’s words and relies on them over and over again.
