Obinze’s mother acts as almost a replacement mentor for Ifemelu once Aunty Uju begins devoting her time and energy to pleasing the General. In contrast to Aunty Uju’s claim that the only way to get by in Nigeria is to ingratiate oneself to powerful people, which leads Aunty Uju to place her self-worth in men, Obinze’s mother provides an alternative view. She is an outspoken woman, a professor who refused to stand down in the face of misogyny at the university she taught at in Nsukka. After her husband’s death, she prioritizes Obinze and doesn’t marry another man, living a good, meaningful life without needing a partner. When she meets Ifemelu, she speaks with her frankly and honestly. She gives Ifemelu a sex talk that focuses not on shame or purity, but rather speaking frankly with Ifemelu about the consequences of pregnancy. She is unapologetically herself and only invites falsehood into her life when she believes that Obinze can no longer be happy in Nigeria. In this way, Obinze’s mother offers an example of Nigerian womanhood that is in line with Ifemelu’s values.
