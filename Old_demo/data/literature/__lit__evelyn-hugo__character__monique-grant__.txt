Monique struggles throughout the novel to prioritize her own needs and desires, and she strives to overcome her lack of confidence. She questions her talent, her ability to accomplish the task Evelyn set before her, and what she wants from her marriage. Despite this, in many ways, Monique is just as ambitious as Evelyn. For example, she seizes the opportunity to write Evelyn’s biography while cutting Vivant out of the interview. 

During her interview with Evelyn, Monique learns to adopt some of Evelyn’s ferocity, and strives to be as bold as Evelyn and to live a life worthy of the name her late father gave her. She negotiates for a promotion and a raise and takes up the role of biographer with aplomb. Learning the truth behind her father’s death, Monique mourns that she lived her whole life believing a lie. In a way, getting the final word on Evelyn’s story allows her to correct this tragedy. Monique moves toward forgiveness, has the power to decide if her father’s story will be made public, and comes into her own as a successful writer.
