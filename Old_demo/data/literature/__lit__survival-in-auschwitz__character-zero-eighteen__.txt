As his name “Null” (Zero) implies, this young man barely out of childhood is known throughout the Lager for having lost all spark of humanity. Somewhere along the way his spirit died, leaving behind a robotic survivor. Null’s work ethic is doggedly mechanical. No one wants him as a work partner as he doesn’t pace himself, disregarding his own welfare and anyone else’s. Levi finds in his indifference to people and circumstances the ultimate slave mentality wrought by the dehumanizing policies of the German SS. In this respect, Null Achtzehn represents the antagonist to Levi’s protagonist, the bane of the camp existence, and a cautionary tale to be resisted.
