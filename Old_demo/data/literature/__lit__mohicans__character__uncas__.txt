Uncas changes more than any other character over the course
				of the novel. He pushes the limits of interracial relationships,
				moving beyond Hawkeye’s same-sex interracial friendships and falling
				in love with Cora, a white woman. Whereas Cooper values interracial friendship
				between men, he presents interracial sexuality as difficult and
				perhaps always doomed. In the end, Uncas is punished for his taboo
				desires, perhaps because Cooper thinks he should be punished, or
				perhaps because Cooper wants to show that Uncas’s close-minded society
				will punish racial mixing. Hawkeye becomes a father figure for Uncas,
				and Uncas eventually becomes a natural leader of men by combining
				the skill of Hawkeye with the spirituality of a revered Indian leader.
