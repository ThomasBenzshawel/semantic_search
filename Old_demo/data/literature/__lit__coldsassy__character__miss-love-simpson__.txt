Miss Love is a spirited young woman capable of speaking
				her mind, which makes her the perfect companion for the outspoken
				Rucker. The passages in which she appears bustle with fresh air,
				sunshine, color, and sexuality, reflecting her vigor. Miss Love
				also has a vulnerable side, and although she meets Cold Sassy’s
				disapproval with cheery strength, she spends much of her early married
				life shedding private tears. Miss Love agrees with Rucker’s policy
				of greeting all hardship with boisterous tolerance, but their attitude
				of cheerful resignation has its flaws. It isn’t until Miss Love
				begins to express her dismay at Cold Sassy’s unfriendliness that
				she becomes happy. 

	As Rucker and Miss Love’s relationship develops and they
				begin to fall in love with each other, Miss Love reveals the abuse
				that darkens her past and makes her feel polluted and unworthy of
				love. Although it pains her to reveal her history, by doing so she
				deepens her connection to Rucker, ceases to worry that she is hiding
				a scandalous secret, and eventually becomes truly happy. Her bravery demonstrates
				that honesty can improve even the worst circumstances. Burns portrays
				the trauma of Miss Love’s childhood as she portrays death—dark,
				but not hopeless. Miss Love helps Rucker by showing him her ability
				to convert pain into happiness.
