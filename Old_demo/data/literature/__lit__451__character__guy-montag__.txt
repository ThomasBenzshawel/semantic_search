Appropriately named after a paper-manufacturing company,
Montag is the protagonist of Fahrenheit 451. He
is by no means a perfect hero, however. The reader can sympathize
with Montag’s mission, but the steps he takes toward his goal often
seem clumsy and misguided. Montag’s faith in his profession and
his society begins to decline almost immediately after the novel’s
opening passage. Faced with the enormity and complexity of books
for the first time, he is often confused, frustrated, and overwhelmed.
As a result, he has difficulty deciding what to do independently
of Beatty, Mildred, or Faber. Likewise, he is often rash, inarticulate,
self-obsessed, and too easily swayed. At times he is not even aware
of why he does things, feeling that his hands are acting by themselves.
These subconscious actions can be quite horrific, such as when he
finds himself setting his supervisor on fire, but they also represent
his deepest desires to rebel against the status quo and find a meaningful
way to live.

In his desperate quest to define and comprehend
his own life and purpose by means of books, he blunders blindly
and stupidly as often as he thinks and acts lucidly. His attempts
to reclaim his own humanity range from the compassionate and sensitive,
as in his conversations with Clarisse, to the grotesque and irresponsible,
as in his murder of Beatty and his half-baked scheme to overthrow
the firemen.
