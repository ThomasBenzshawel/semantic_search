Frodo’s role as the main protagonist of The Lord
					of the Rings changes significantly in the novel’s final
				volume. Frodo no longer leads the quest, but is increasingly led
				by others and by circumstance. We wonder in what sense Frodo remains
				the true Ring-bearer if he himself must be borne by others in order
				to carry on his quest. For a brief time at the opening of Book VI,
				Frodo does not even possess the Ring. Lying naked in the tower of
				Cirith Ungol, Frodo appears a lifeless shell with little control
				of the Ring’s movement toward Mount Doom. After the quest is completed,
				Frodo looms in the background of the events in Middle-earth and
				slips into irrelevance in his home, the Shire. Frodo explains to
				Sam in the last chapter that he is “wounded” in a way that will
				never heal. Certainly, Frodo is far from morbid or pitiful. His
				once-youthful nobility now appears a weathered reticence. Rather,
				Frodo is wounded because all the experiences after Mount Doom seem
				like a trite footnote. More important, Frodo feels wounded because
				he has completed a grand quest in which the goal—to get rid of something—was
				distinctly negative. In this, Frodo remains the true hero, for he has
				succeeded in a task that no one really wanted. The quest is both futile
				and yet the most important deed of all. Frodo’s loss of vigor and
				identity after such a strange accomplishment propels his desire to
				sail away to the paradise of the West.
