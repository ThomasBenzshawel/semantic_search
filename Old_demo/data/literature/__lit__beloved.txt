Beloved by Toni Morrison, published in 1987, is a powerful and haunting novel set in post-Civil War Ohio. The story revolves around Sethe, an escaped enslaved woman, and her haunted past. The ghost of Sethe’s dead daughter, known as Beloved, returns to haunt her, and the novel delves into the impact of slavery on individuals and communities. Through the exploration of trauma, memory, and the search for identity, Morrison weaves a narrative that confronts the brutal legacy of slavery and its enduring effects on the lives of Black Americans.

The novel takes place in the Reconstruction era, a time of profound social and political change in the United States. The community in Cincinnati, where Sethe seeks refuge, reflects the challenges faced by formerly enslaved individuals as they strive for freedom and rebuild their lives.
