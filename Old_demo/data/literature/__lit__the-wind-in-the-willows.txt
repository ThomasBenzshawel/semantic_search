Kenneth Grahame’s beloved 1908 novel is a picaresque with epic overtones. In it, the Water Rat, the Mole, and the Badger explore a world full of wonder, cope with their fears, and attempt to rescue the Toad from his worst impulses. Numerous illustrated editions, most famously by E. H. Shepard, have been published, and the book, in whole or in part, has been adapted for radio, stage, film, and television. Literary retellings focus on the book’s class and gender issues, although the tales originated simply as bedtime stories for Grahame’s son Alastair.
