In Anne’s eyes, Mr. Frank is one of the kindest, smartest,
				most gentle and thoughtful fathers imaginable. He almost always
				supports Anne and frequently takes her side during family arguments.
				He is generous, kind, and levelheaded, while the other adults in
				the annex can be stingy, harsh, and emotional. Unlike Mr. Dussel,
				for example, Mr. Frank always tries to save the best food for the
				children and takes the smallest portion for himself.

Anne feels a special closeness to her father, since she
				sees herself as more similar to him than to her mother or sister.
				Anne continually tries to impress her father, live up to his expectations,
				and obey his wishes. However, when she begins a close relationship
				with Peter, her father deems it inappropriate, and he asks her to
				stop visiting Peter in the upstairs part of the annex. Anne is very
				hurt that her father is so conservative, protective, and secretive
				about sexuality, and she is upset that he does not approve of her
				relationship. Out of respect for her father and in an attempt to
				please him, Anne begins to spend less time with Peter.

Otto was a smart, resourceful, and caring father, as well
				as a talented businessman. He had a strong character and was clearly
				the head of the Frank household. The only resident of the annex
				to survive the war, Otto remained in Auschwitz until it was liberated
				by Russian troops in 1945.
				He returned to Holland, where he receives Anne’s diary. He remained
				in Holland until 1953,
				when he moved to Basel, Switzerland, to join his sister’s family.
				He married another Auschwitz survivor and devoted the rest of his
				life to promoting Anne’s diary.
