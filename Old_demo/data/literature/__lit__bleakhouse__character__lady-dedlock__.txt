Lady Dedlock wears a cold, haughty mask because she has
				a secret to hide: a great passion that led to an illegitimate child
				and heartbreak. Until we discover this secret, Lady Dedlock seems
				to be little more than an unpleasant member of high society, bored
				with absolutely everything and unwilling to be bothered by anyone,
				including her husband, Sir Leicester. Lady Dedlock seems not to
				care about or have any interest in the world around her. When we
				discover her secret, however, we know all this to be false. Far
				from being disengaged from the world because of snobbery, Lady Dedlock
				keeps the world at arm’s length out of fear and pain: fear that
				her secret will be revealed and bring the whole Dedlock family tumbling
				down, and pain from events from her past. Regal, stone-cold Lady
				Dedlock, watched and talked about by the public as though she is
				greater than life, has a very human, very messy past that throbs
				beneath her unshakeable exterior.

When Lady Dedlock finds that her past is catching up with
				her, she begins acting in a way that seems shockingly inappropriate
				for a woman of the Dedlock name. For example, she disguises herself
				and asks Jo, a street urchin, to show her the burial ground of the
				dead lodger, who we eventually learn was her former lover. When
				Esther is sick, Lady Dedlock disguises herself again and tries to
				find out information about her by going to the brickmaker’s cottage.
				And when she fears her secret is about to come out, she leaves her
				jewels and money behind and flees, eventually dying on the street.
				Lady Dedlock, who seems at first to have no passion, ultimately
				shows herself to be so passionate that she will die to protect those
				she loves.
