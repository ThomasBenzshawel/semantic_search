The third March sister, Beth is very shy and quiet. Like
				Meg, she always tries to please other people, and like Jo, she is
				concerned with keeping the family together. Beth struggles with
				minor faults, such as her resentment for the housework she must
				do.

	Beth resembles an old-fashioned heroine like those in
				the novels of the nineteenth-century English author Charles Dickens.
				Beth is a good person, but she is also a shade too angelic to survive
				in Alcott’s more realistic fictional world. With Beth’s death, Alcott
				lets an old type of heroine die off. The three surviving March sisters
				are strong enough to live in the changing real world.

	Beth is close to Jo; outgoing Jo and quiet Beth both
				have antisocial tendencies. Neither of them wants to live in the
				world the way it is, with women forced to conform to social conventions
				of female behavior. Similarly, it is not surprising that Meg and
				Amy are particularly close to each other, since generous Meg and
				selfish Amy both find their places within a gendered world.
