The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was written in batches by the American Founding Father, scientist, and entrepreneur, Benjamin Franklin, from 1771 to 1788. Parts of it were published as early as 1791 (in French), although all four parts were not published together in English until 1868. According to a friend of Franklin’s, one the goals of the autobiography was to provide a model by which others could better their lives—and, in fact, it stands as one of the first examples of a “self-help” book. It is also considered important in the development of the autobiography genre.
