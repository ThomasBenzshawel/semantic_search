Giovanni Boccaccioâ€™s The Decameron is a masterpiece of world literature that inspired Chaucer, Shakespeare, Poe, and countless writers of popular fiction for more than 650 years since its original publication around the year 1350. Taking place in the plague year of 1348 in Florence, Italy, The Decameron follows ten wealthy young people who abandon the city for a luxurious country retreat. Once there, they attempt to banish their sorrows by communing with nature, singing, dancing, and telling stories; in all, one hundred stories are told.
