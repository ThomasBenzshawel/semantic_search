Krik? Krak! is a collection of nine short stories by Haitian-American author Edwidge Danticat that was first published in 1995. A finalist for the National Book Award, Krik? Krak! examines the lives of ordinary Haitians, particularly those struggling to survive under the brutal Duvalier regime. Danticat skillfully illuminates the distance between people’s desires and the stifling reality of their lives.
