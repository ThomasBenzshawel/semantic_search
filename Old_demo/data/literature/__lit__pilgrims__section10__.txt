Christiana and her group arrive at the spot where Christian
					once met Little-Faith. There they meet Valiant-for-truth standing
					with his sword drawn. Valiant-for-truth says three thieves jumped
					him, and after much strenuous combat he repelled them. Great-heart expresses
					amazement that one man could turn away three attackers and asks
					why Valiant-for-truth did not call for aid. Valiant-for-truth says
					he asked the Lord for help silently and received it. He then tells the
					story of his pilgrimage and how he passed through the same obstacles
					that Christian did. When Valiant-for-truth admits he learned from
					Christian’s example, Great-heart is pleased that Christian’s story
					has spread so widely.

The pilgrims travel onward, accompanied by Valiant-for-truth. In
					the Enchanted Ground, they become weary, and the landscape grows
					dark around them. They stumble, drag their feet, and eventually
					they come upon a place of rest, an arbor with couches. They warn
					themselves not to rest there, since the place is a trick to thwart pilgrims.
					Proceeding on, they find another arbor with two pilgrims, Heedless
					and Too-bold, asleep on couches inside. The pilgrims try to awaken
					the sleepers, who make nonsensical replies to them. Great-heart
					says they talk in their sleep and that their words are spoken without
					reason. Great-heart lights a lantern to brighten the group’s way
					onward through the darkness.

Beyond the Enchanted Ground, they find a pilgrim kneeling
					in prayer. His name is Standfast. Valiant-for-truth asks him why
					he is on the ground. Standfast explains that he has just turned
					away a tall, attractive dark woman who offered him her bed, her
					money, and herself. The woman spoke smoothly, smiling at the end
					of each sentence, and fingered her purse while talking. Standfast
					says he rejected her, and Great-heart recognizes this woman as Madam Bubble,
					whom some see as a goddess but who has no real powers. According
					to Great-heart, she loves parties and money and has been stirring
					up trouble since biblical times. Great-heart commends Standfast
					for rejecting her.

The pilgrims arrive in the land of Beulah, home of the
					Celestial City. The locals clothe the pilgrims in fresh garments.
					The local children bring them perfumed bouquets. A special-delivery
					letter arrives for Christiana announcing that the Master expects
					to see her before him within ten days. The messenger gives Christiana
					a token to assure her of his legitimacy: an arrow that enters her
					heart and spreads love there. Christiana visits each of the pilgrims
					and bids them farewell.

Each of the remaining pilgrims also receives a special
					post from the Master. Ready-to-halt wishes to leave a legacy, so
					he bequeaths his crutches to his son before departing. Feeble-mind
					regrets having nothing to bequeath. He leaves too, as does each
					of the others. The narrator says he does not know what happened
					to Christiana’s sons and their families. He left before he found
					out, but he has heard they are still alive.

The author succinctly says goodbye to the reader.

The emphasis on women in Part II culminates in the figure
					of Madam Bubble, the last thwarter met by any of the pilgrims. Madam
					Bubble is a vibrant and colorful character. She is evil but also
					scintillating. To accentuate her character, Bunyan adds realistic details
					about mannerisms and gestures that he rarely grants to the other
					characters, such as the way Bubble smiles and touches her purse
					while she speaks. This vibrant representation of her character reinforces
					her majesty and power, which some may understand to be divine. Strong
					and dominating, Madam Bubble is the opposite of the strong female
					pilgrims in Part II. She is the anti-heroine whose wicked power
					balances the good power of the positive heroines Mercy and Christiana.

Heedless and Too-bold display the importance of communication
					in The Pilgrim’s Progress. Bunyan insists that
					pilgrimage demands understanding as well as travel. These two failed
					pilgrims have done almost everything right, having reached the very
					outskirts of the Celestial City. Obviously they made it through
					the Slough of Despond, past Giant Despair, and survived all the
					challenges facing the other pilgrims. Clearly Heedless and Too-bold
					are admirable characters. However, the pilgrims’ only failing is
					that they talk in their sleep. This flaw summarizes their failure
					to communicate rationally and their failure to deeply understand
					pilgrimage. They may have performed all the deeds of a good pilgrim,
					but they can only babble about the meaning of their achievements.
					In the end, they have failed.

The pilgrims’ encounter with Valiant-for-truth demonstrates again
					how Christian’s earlier pilgrimage affects the present one. They
					meet Valiant-for-truth at the exact spot where Christian met Little-Faith,
					whom the same thieves attacked. Bunyan directly contrasts the two
					characters by involving them in distinctly parallel situations.
					Where Little-Faith is known for his cowardice, Valiant-for-truth
					is known for his courage and skill. The second pilgrimage does not
					just repeat the first pilgrimage but grows from it and expands on it.
					The fact that Valiant-for-truth and so many other characters have learned
					from Christian’s example shows that Part I is more than a prequel
					to Part II. Christian’s journey also provides a lesson that the characters
					in Part II learn from.

The detail about Christiana and the others meeting their
					maker suggests that their final destination is death. Unlike Christian
					in Part I, Christiana’s group not only arrives in the Celestial
					City but actually die and meet their maker, the Master, who seems
					to be God himself. They fulfill their pilgrimage more dramatically
					and solemnly than Christian did at the end of Part I. Christian
					arrived at his joyous destination but without any mention of an
					encounter with God. Ready-to-halt seems to understand that he will
					not return from his trip to see the Master, and this is evident
					when he arranges to give his crutches to his son. While Christian’s
					tale ended with his heavenly joy, Bunyan suggests in Part II that
					this joy comes after life is over.
