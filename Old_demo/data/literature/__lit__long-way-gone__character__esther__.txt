Esther is an important catalyst for Ishmael’s rehabilitation and healing at the end of the story. A nurse from the rehabilitation center, Esther befriends Ishmael and teaches him how to forgive himself and trust others. Her life is dedicated to helping former child soldiers, and she has a special way of connecting with them. She gives Ishmael a Walkman and a rap cassette, both of which serve as a reminder of his former life and are symbolic of Ishmael’s lost innocence. Esther also encourages Ishmael to confide in her about his dreams and the terrible things he experienced in the war. Esther’s compassionate response helps Ishmael continue to open up about his experiences and begin to process his trauma. When Ishmael tells Esther that he doesn’t see a reason to live without his family, Esther says that she will be his temporary sister, which helps Ishmael find the hope he needs to continue healing and highlights the importance of human connection in Ishmael’s rehabilitation.
