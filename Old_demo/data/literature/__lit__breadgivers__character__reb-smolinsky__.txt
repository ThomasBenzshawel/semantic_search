Having spent his entire life wrapped up in the study of the Torah and
				other holy books, Reb Smolinsky lives in his own private world of religious
				study, a world that is sometimes highly incompatible with the one in which the
				rest of his family lives. His days and nights are focused on the promise of
				heaven and offering charitable contributions to others, making him unable to see
				that on Earth, a man needs to make sure his own children are fed before he gives
				to strangers. In the holy works, men are good and kind, and they value the
				importance of study; he attempts to translate this awareness to a world where
				people donâ€™t care what your excuses are for not paying them and try to cheat you
				on business deals. Even more damaging to himself and those around him is the
				fact that in his world of words, Reb Smolinsky is incredibly knowledgeable. He
				mistakenly believes this means that he is equally knowledgeable in the outside
				world, and he makes potentially foolish decisions without feeling the need to
				consult his much more sensible wife. If his decisions prove to have been poorly
				made, Reb Smolinsky refuses to admit this to himself and will allow the decision
				to degrade further rather than to confess that he might have been
				wrong.
