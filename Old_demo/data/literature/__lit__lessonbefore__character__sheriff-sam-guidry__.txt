Guidry is both an archetypal white authoritarian and a
				decent man. Guidry voices the ignorance, hypocrisy, inertia, and
				racism of the people in power in the South of the 1940s.
				As town sheriff, Guidry has plenty of power to wield. He resents
				any trespasses on his sphere of influence, and he wants to maintain
				the status quo in his courthouse and in his society. He believes
				that Jefferson should be left to die in happy, animalistic ignorance.
				Still, as soon as Jefferson and Grant begin to transcend the roles
				that Guidry and other powerful whites assign for them—as soon as
				they cease playing the humble schoolteacher and the angry, stupid
				criminal—Guidry seems to sense the fragility of his position. His
				worldview depends upon blacks conforming to these stereotypes; when
				they refuse to conform, Guidry becomes unsure of his footing. Although
				Guidry does not repent and change, he does show signs of increasing
				sensitivity. His harsh exterior begins to crack and reveal a kindly,
				anxious streak. By the end of the novel, he treats Jefferson with
				something approaching respect.
