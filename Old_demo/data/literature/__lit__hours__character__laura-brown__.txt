Laura Brown, like many women of her generation, married
				young and has settled into the roles of wife and mother at a relatively young
				age. Laura feels surprised by the direction her life has taken. In
				high school, her husband, Dan, was popular while she was a shy bookworm.
				Dan became a war hero, and when he returned to California he married
				Laura and they had a child. Laura feels as though she has woken
				up in someone else’s life, and her role as a housewife suffocates
				her. She thinks that she should be happy, because her husband is
				kind, her son loves her, and they live in a nice home. 

Laura feels that something is wrong with her but tries
				to convince herself that she is normal. She seeks comfort in books,
				specifically Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway. Through
				reading, she can step out of her life and critically examine her
				own experiences. The subject matter of suicide also forces her to
				consider the idea that she wants to find a way out of her own life.
				In the final chapter of The Hours, we find out
				that Laura attempted suicide and ultimately left her family to move
				to Canada. The day described in The Hours shows Laura
				considering these two possibilities, possibly providing the catalyst
				for making the decision to leave her family.
