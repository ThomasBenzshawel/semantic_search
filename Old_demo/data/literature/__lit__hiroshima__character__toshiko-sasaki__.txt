Miss Sasaki is a twenty-year-old clerk who works hard
				to take care of her siblings and parents. The bomb collapses the
				factory where she works, and she becomes pinned underneath a bookcase
				that crushes her leg. For weeks she receives no real medical care
				for her badly fractured and infected leg, and she remains crippled
				for the rest of her life. After the war she suffers greatly as a
				bomb victim and a cripple. Her fianc√© abandons her, and she is scarred
				emotionally as well as physically. After Father Kleinsorge encourages
				her to convert to Christianity and become a nun, she has a distinguished career,
				travels around the world, and becomes optimistic about her future.

	Miss Sasaki comes closest to representing the many nameless, wounded
				survivors of the bomb. Several doctors treat her callously; because
				her injury is severe but not mortal or mysterious, she garners very
				little sympathy from anyone. She is completely immobilized, so she
				does not become involved in the communal efforts that most of the
				other characters take part in. As a result, she suffers mostly in
				isolation.
