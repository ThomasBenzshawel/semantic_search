Elizabeth-Jane undergoes a drastic transformation over
				the course of the novel, even though the narrative does not focus
				on her as much as it does on other characters. As she follows her
				mother across the English countryside in search of a relative she
				does not know, Elizabeth-Jane proves a kind, simple, and uneducated
				girl. Once in Casterbridge, however, she undertakes intellectual
				and social improvement: she begins to dress like a lady, reads voraciously,
				and does her best to expunge rustic country dialect from her speech.
				This self-education comes at a painful time, for not long after
				she arrives in Casterbridge, her mother dies, leaving her in the custody
				of a man who has learned that she is not his biological daughter
				and therefore wants little to do with her.

In terms of misery, one could easily argue that Elizabeth-Jane
				has a share equal to that of Henchard or Lucetta. Unlike these characters,
				however, Elizabeth-Jane suffers in the same way she lives—with a
				quiet kind of self-possession and resolve. She lacks Lucetta’s sense
				of drama and lacks her stepfather’s desire to bend the will of others
				to her own. Thus, when Henchard cruelly dismisses her or Lucetta
				supplants her place in Farfrae’s heart, Elizabeth-Jane accepts these
				circumstances and moves on with life. This approach to living stands
				as a bold counterpoint to Henchard’s, for Henchard cannot bring
				himself to let go of the past and relinquish his failures and unfulfilled
				desires. If Henchard’s determination to cling to the past is partly
				responsible for his ruin, then Elizabeth-Jane’s talent for “making
				limited opportunities endurable” accounts for her triumphal realization—unspectacular
				as it might be—that “happiness was but the occasional episode in
				a general drama of pain.”
