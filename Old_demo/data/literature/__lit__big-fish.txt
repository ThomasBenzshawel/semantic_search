Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions by American author Daniel Wallace is a modern example of magical realism that was published in 1998. At its center are Edward and William Bloom, father and son, whose troubled relationship is riddled with outrageous tall tales told by Edward and recalled by Will. A few stories are realistic truths, some are exaggerations, and many are outright lies. The tales include vicious beasts, a humble giant, a magic glass eye, a devoted wife, a dedicated doctor, and a dreamlike town called Specter. Made into a film by director Tim Burton in 2003, Big Fish blurs the line between fantasy and reality and questions what it means to live—and die.
