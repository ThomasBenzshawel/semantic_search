Tō-no-Chūjō is Genji’s brother-in-law and close friend. Like Genji, he displays many of the qualities prized by Heian Japan: he is a gifted dancer, an expressive poet, and a charismatic presence at court.

However, he is regularly bested by Genji in their contests over women. Although an admirable person, he pales when compared to Genji’s shining example. As the second chapter makes clear, Tō-no-Chūjō is less kind and more dogmatic than Genji. Genji meets Yūgao, the woman that Tō-no-Chūjō describes in the conversation from “The Broom-Like Tree," and concludes that his friend has been mistaken in his assessment of her. Where Tō-no-Chūjō saw someone insipid, Genji finds a woman full of charm. After Yūgao’s death, Genji not only takes charge of her attendants and child, he chides his friend for the poor treatment of the gentle and lovely soul.  

Still, when Genji is sent to exile, Tō-no-Chūjō defies Lady Koki-den’s order that the court suspend all communication with Genji, even though his status has been damaged by his father’s retirement. In the relationship between Genji and Tō-no-Chūjō, Marusaki offers a compelling portrait of intimate male friends.
