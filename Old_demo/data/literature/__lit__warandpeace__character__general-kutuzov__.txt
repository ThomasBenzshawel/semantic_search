The commander of the Russian forces against Napoleon,
				Kutuzov is old, fat, and one-eyed—hardly the archetypal image of
				military leadership. Yet Kutuzov is a brilliant strategist as well
				as a practiced philosopher of human nature, and Tolstoy’s respect
				for him is greater than for any other government functionary among
				the French or Russians—greater even than his respect for the somewhat oblivious
				Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov is humble and spiritual, in sharp contrast
				to the vain and self-absorbed Napoleon with his cold use of logic.
				After the Battle of Borodino, Kutuzov stops at a church procession
				and kneels in gratitude to a holy icon, demonstrating a humility
				of which Napoleon certainly would be incapable. Kutuzov is motivated
				by personal belief rather than the desire for acceptance, which
				makes his final fall from grace only a minor tragedy for him. Whereas
				Napoleon is always convinced of being absolutely right, Kutuzov
				is more realistic and wary about the state of things. He hesitates
				to declare a Russian victory at Borodino despite the obvious advantages
				of doing so, partly because the experiences of his long career have
				proved that reality is always more complex than one initially thinks.
				Such awareness of the mysteries of existence win Kutuzov our—and
				Tolstoy’s—approval.
