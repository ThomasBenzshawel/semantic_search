Arthur Jarvis is murdered before we even hear of him,
				but his writings provide him with the opportunity to speak for himself.
				A staunch opponent of South Africa’s racial injustices, Arthur Jarvis spent
				his life at the center of the debates on racism and poverty, and his
				essays and articles provide answers to many of the novel’s questions.
				His motives are selfless; he works for change not because he seeks
				personal glory but because he is weary of the system’s contradictions
				and oppression. As much as Msimangu, Arthur Jarvis is the solution
				South Africa needs, and although he is murdered, some hope lives
				on in his young son.
