Jurgis quickly realizes that he cannot get change for
					a one-hundred-dollar bill without raising suspicions or being robbed.
					He enters a saloon to try anyway. The bartender tells Jurgis that
					he must buy a drink first. Jurgis agrees to have a glass of beer
					for five cents. The bartender takes the bill and gives him ninety-five
					cents in change. Realizing that he has been cheated, Jurgis furiously
					attacks the bartender. A policeman rushes in and drags Jurgis to
					jail. The judge at his trial finds Jurgis’s version of events laughable.
					He sentences Jurgis to ten days in jail plus costs.

Jurgis again encounters Jack Duane in Bridewell
					Prison. Jurgis agrees to see Duane when he gets out of jail. Jurgis
					listens to the other prisoners and decides that a life of crime
					is the best way to survive. He visits Jack at a pawnshop where he
					is hiding out, and Jack takes him on his first mugging. They
					attack a well-dressed man and steal his jewelry and wallet. Jurgis’s
					share is fifty-five dollars. Jurgis reads in the paper that the
					victim suffered a concussion and nearly froze to death while he was
					unconscious; he will lose three fingers to frostbite. Over time,
					Jurgis ceases to worry about what happens to his victims.

Through Duane, Jurgis becomes acquainted with Chicago’s criminal
					underground. On one outing, a watchman catches Duane breaking a
					safe. A policeman allows him to escape, but it causes such a scandal
					that Duane’s criminal associates choose to sacrifice him. Duane
					then flees Chicago. Meanwhile, Jurgis begins talking with Harper,
					a vote-buyer for the corrupt politicians of Chicago. An election
					is coming up, and Harper offers to let Jurgis take part in the schemes.
					Harper introduces him to Mike Scully, a wealthy, corrupt democrat.
					Scully wants Jurgis to take a job in the stockyards and join a union.
					Scully and the Republicans have made a pact, and Scully wants Jurgis
					to support a Republican candidate.

Jurgis takes a job as a hog trimmer for which
					he receives regular pay in addition to the fruits of political graft.
					He works tirelessly for the Republican candidate and, when it comes
					time to vote, -ushers group after group of immigrant workers through
					the polls. The Republican candidate is elected to office and Jurgis
					becomes three hundred dollars richer. He treats himself to a long
					drinking binge. Meanwhile, Packingtown is alive with celebration
					over the political victory.

[T]he blazing midsummer sun beat down
						upon that square mile of abominations . . . rivers of hot blood
						and carloads of moist flesh . . .

Jurgis keeps his job as a hog trimmer. In May, the unions
					and the packers clash and a huge strike begins. Scully denounces
					the packers in the papers, so Jurgis asks for another job while
					he strikes with the rest. Scully tells him to be a scab and make
					as much as he can out of it. Jurgis argues for a wage of three dollars
					a day and receives it. The packers hire all of the thugs in the
					city and import scabs from all over the country, including a significant
					number of southern blacks.

Jurgis is offered a position as a boss on the killing
					beds. The packers are desperate to provide fresh meat in order to
					keep public opinion from turning against them. Jurgis receives a
					higher wage and the promise that he will have the job after the
					strike. Nevertheless, the packers feel pressure from the public
					to settle. They reach an agreement with the union, but the packers
					break their promise to not discriminate against union leaders. In
					response, the workers return to striking. During the storm of debauchery
					that follows, Jurgis comes face to face with Phil Connor in Packingtown.
					Without thinking, he viciously attacks Connor. Jurgis calls Harper
					from his jail cell only to discover that Connor is one of Scully’s
					favorites. Harper can do nothing for him except get his
					bail lowered so that Jurgis can pay it. He advises Jurgis to skip
					town. Jurgis pays his bail, which leaves him with less than four
					dollars, and he travels to the other end of Chicago.

Jurgis’s entrance into the underworld of crime demonstrates
					that merciless predation, thievery, and dishonesty are far better rewarded
					in the universe of The Jungle than commitment to
					fundamental American values. It also provides a look into the corruption of
					the justice system and the democratic political process. Jurgis makes
					far more money by mugging, rigging elections, and working as a scab
					than he did as a regular wage earner. Sinclair again ironically
					positions capitalism, which is generally considered to be the forum
					of the American Dream, as a threat to the American way. Whereas
					Jurgis earlier fails to achieve this dream when he submits himself
					wholeheartedly to the process that he believes will garner him that life
					for which he longs, he now succeeds by means of tactics antithetical to
					the values of hard work and honesty. The profits that he makes from these
					practices assuages his conscience, so that he cares only about himself
					and can completely ignore the suffering of his victims, just as
					the real estate agent and various foremen earlier ignore his suffering.

Jurgis heads down the road of corruption and dishonesty,
					and Sinclair uses the encounter with Phil Connor to illustrate that
					any remaining vestige of morality or desire to achieve the American Dream
					by honest means is pointless for Jurgis. His instinctive attack on
					Connor evidences a lingering sense of injustice at Connor’s rape of
					Ona. But though this sentiment may be somewhat noble, it only lands
					him in prison again, which inevitably leads to his losing all of his
					money again. Sinclair, thus, reasserts the worthlessness of moral values
					in the face of capitalism, as one cannot gain ground by clinging
					to such idealistic values when corruption abounds.

In particular, Sinclair focuses on the moral depredations
					of capitalism, especially the corrupting influence of vice among
					the laborers as a means of escaping the miseries of their lives.
					He describes the depravity and immorality that run unchecked among
					the scab workers in order to charge the meat packers with encouraging
					sinful behavior. Gambling, fighting, and prostitution run rampant
					in the population of scab workers. He describes how these prostitutes, criminals,
					and gamblers handle the meat that is sold to the American public.
					Sinclair equates the moral “dirtiness” of the scab workers with
					the literal dirtiness of the meat itself.

Sinclair’s representation of the scab workers attacks
					the meat packers by association. The filth and immorality of the
					scabs rubs off on their employers. However, the racism prevalent
					in turn-of-the-century white America begins to creep into Sinclair’s
					narrative at this stage. Many of the scab workers are black southerners,
					to whom Sinclair often refers as “big buck Negroes.” The black scab workers
					are continually described as lazy, ignorant, criminal, and self-destructive.
					Furthermore, he conjures images of these “big buck Negroes” rubbing
					elbows with white country girls, knowing that the idea of black
					men cavorting with white women would raise the ire of white readers.
					Sinclair states that their ancestors were once African savages forced
					into slavery; now, however, they are really “free” for the first
					time—“free to wreck themselves.” In his fervent attempt to rouse
					the reading public’s moral outrage against big capitalists, Sinclair
					reproduces, unfortunately, some of the most racist stereotypes against
					blacks.
