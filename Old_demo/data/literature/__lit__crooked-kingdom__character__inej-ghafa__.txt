Inej’s journey throughout the novel is one of trust, both in herself and in Kaz’s muted affections. Because she is imprisoned at the start of the novel, the need for these two kinds of trust is foregrounded as she struggles to acknowledge her own skills and to believe that Kaz will rescue her. Her father’s advice about fear provides key guidance: she understands that fear has something to teach her if she can listen to its lessons, rather than try to escape or outmaneuver it. Doing so allows her to keep her head throughout the novel as she attempts to outwit Bajan, bluff Van Eck, and outmaneuver Dunyasha. There are moments, though, when fear still gets the better of her, and she doubts her abilities and questions whether Kaz cares for her. In these moments, she is susceptible to hopelessness. Yet, each time, she recovers her balance. Though she is tempted by Bajan’s promises to reunite her with her family, she remains committed to the gang. When Van Eck calls her bluff, she is fierce in the face of his threats. And when Dunyasha seems to have her beaten, she continues to fight nonetheless. In addition to listening to fear, Inej also learns to trust Kaz by confronting him directly about their relationship. When she asks if he would ever abandon her, he tells her passionately that he would stay by her side no matter what. This uncharacteristically open exchange allows Inej to move toward fully trusting Kaz.
