The Englishman is a well-educated and ambitious aspiring alchemist. He is
				adventurous enough to join a caravan in search of the alchemist, but is rather
				anti-social. He prefers to read his large collection of books rather than interact
				with others or take interest in his surroundings. Because the Englishman and
				Santiago share a commitment to pursuing their Personal Legends, they quickly become
				friends. The Englishman, however, also challenges Santiago with his intellectual,
				knowledge-focused approach to life. He teaches Santiago the value of book learning
				and introduces him to important concepts in alchemy, such as the Master Work. But he
				must also learn from Santiago the importance of experience and
				friendship.

Because the Englishman focuses too much on his books, the alchemist believes
				he has not reached the point in his personal development that would allow him to be
				the alchemist’s protégé. Using the Englishman as its example, the novel suggests
				that even though knowledge gained from books can be useful, one should not rely on
				it solely and unconditionally. True wisdom comes from experience, which one must
				earn through action.
