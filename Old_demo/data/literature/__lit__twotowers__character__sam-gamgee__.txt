In the early parts of The Lord of the Rings, Sam
				comes across as a rather flat character, a sidekick to the more
				interesting and dynamic Frodo, whom he serves. But from a psychological
				point of view, Sam is among the most interesting and complex characters
				in the novel. Like his probable namesake, Pickwick’s servant Sam
				in Charles Dickens’s The Pickwick Papers, Frodo’s
				Sam is earthy and commonsensical, fond of his beer and his bread,
				clever though sometimes forgetful—as when he forgets he has a magic
				Elf rope in his bag. Over the course of The Two Towers, Sam
				changes more than any other character. Initially, he is subservient
				and not quite capable of independent judgment. His constant references
				to Frodo as “Mister Frodo”—a formal title that other characters
				do not use even when addressing kings or Wizards—makes us wonder
				whether Sam suffers from a sense of inferiority. Frodo never orders
				Sam around as a master would command a servant, yet Sam continually
				speaks of himself as serving Frodo.

Eventually, Sam is a servant no more. By the end of The
					Two Towers, when his master lies speechless and paralyzed,
				Sam is forced to affirm his own strength and assume the role of
				Ring-bearer himself. In being forced to make his own decisions,
				he becomes his own master, thereby becoming a symbol of the potential
				for leadership and heroism that may lie dormant in the most unsuspecting people,
				perhaps even ourselves.
