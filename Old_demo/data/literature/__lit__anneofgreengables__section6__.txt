On the last day of June, Anne returns from school with
					red eyes and a soaked handkerchief in her hand. The universally
					disliked schoolteacher, Mr. Phillips, is leaving his job, and his
					farewell speech made all the girls cry. The old minister, Mr. Bentley,
					has also given up his post, and the Avonlea congregation chooses
					a young man named Mr. Allan as Mr. Bentley’s successor. The congregation
					welcomes Mr. Allan and his pretty young wife into the community.
					Anne admires Mrs. Allan, who teaches Anne’s Sunday school class, because
					unlike the previous teacher she encourages the students to ask many
					questions.

	Marilla invites Mr. and Mrs. Allan to tea, and works
					for days preparing a generous spread of food for the young couple.
					Marilla allows Anne to bake a layer cake. Even though Anne has baked many
					cakes, she is nervous nonetheless. The cake comes out of the oven
					looking beautiful, and Anne is proud to serve it to her new hero,
					Mrs. Allan. Mrs. Allan can hardly swallow the cake, but she eats
					it to spare Anne’s feelings. When Marilla tastes the cake herself, she
					asks Anne what ingredients she used. Marilla discovers that Anne
					accidentally used anodyne liniment instead of vanilla, making the
					cake taste awful. Anne is mortified and runs upstairs, throws herself
					on the bed, and weeps. Mrs. Allan cheers Anne up, and Anne begins
					to see some good in the embarrassing situation, saying at least
					she never makes the same mistake twice. She is relieved to think that
					once she has made all possible mistakes, she will be done making
					mistakes for good.

Returning from the post office, Anne is filled with excitement because
					Mrs. Allan has invited her to tea. Marilla explains that Mrs. Allan
					has invited all the children in her Sunday school class, but this news
					does not diminish Anne’s excitement. As usual, Marilla is troubled
					by Anne’s enthusiasm, believing it will cause Anne pain when reality
					does not live up to her expectations. Anne is nervous that she will
					forget her manners and offend Mrs. Allan. Marilla gives her etiquette
					advice and tells her not to think about how she should behave but
					to imagine what sorts of behavior would please Mrs. Allan. After
					tea, Anne describes her time at Mrs. Allan’s home. She admires Mrs.
					Allan so much that she says she wants to become a minister’s wife.
					She tells Marilla that, according to Mrs. Rachel, the school is
					getting a new teacher named Miss Muriel Stacy.

At the end of summer, Diana Barry invites all the girls
					in the Sunday school class to her house for a party. Tired of their
					usual songs and games, the girls decide to embark on more adventurous
					activities. They dare each other to hop around the yard on one foot
					or climb a tree. Josie Pye, a sly girl whom Diana and Anne dislike,
					dares Anne to walk the ridgepole of the Barry’s kitchen roof. Diana
					tries to dissuade Anne from performing such a difficult dare, but
					Anne feels her honor is at stake, so she climbs to the top of the
					roof. She manages to walk a few steps before losing her balance,
					falling to the ground, and breaking her ankle. All the girls rush
					to her side, shrieking and crying. 

	When Marilla sees Mr. Barry carrying Anne back to Green Gables,
					she is terrified that something serious has happened. She realizes
					for the first time how much Anne means to her. Anne rests in bed
					for seven weeks and is pleased to find that many people in Avonlea
					care enough about her to visit. From her friends she hears all about
					the new teacher, Miss Stacy, who dresses beautifully and organizes
					recitations, nature walks, and physical exercises for her class.
					Anne thinks her new teacher will be a kindred spirit.

Anne enjoys her return to school in October. She especially
					adores her new teacher, and flourishes academically and personally
					in Miss Stacy’s innovative schoolhouse. Both Mrs. Rachel and Marilla
					disapprove of Miss Stacy’s novel teaching methods, which include sending
					boys to retrieve birds’ nests from the tops of trees to use as teaching
					tools and leading the children in daily exercises. In November,
					Miss Stacy announces that the school will put on a Christmas concert
					to raise money to buy a Canadian flag for the schoolhouse. Anne
					is even more excited than the rest of the students and anxiously
					awaits the performance of her two recitations. Marilla declares
					the concert “foolishness,” so Anne talks to Matthew about the concert.
					He reflects that he is glad that he has no part in bringing up Anne,
					since his lack of involvement allows him to spoil her.

Anne benefits from the teaching methods of Mrs. Allan
					and Miss Stacy. Education under Mr. Phillips, Marilla, and Mr. Bell,
					Anne’s former Sunday school teacher, consists of memorizing and
					reciting facts and moral lessons, which grates on Anne’s imaginative
					spirit. The more interesting, innovative methods of Mrs. Allan and
					Miss Stacy fit better with Anne’s learning style. In addition to
					learning schoolwork more readily, Anne begins to learn the nature
					of adulthood from her new teachers. When Mrs. Allan comforts her
					after the cake mishap, Anne begins to think more forgivingly of
					her own mistakes, telling Marilla that at least she learns from
					her errors.

	Anne’s views about religion and school change because
					of her friendships with Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy. Previously, Anne
					says her prayers to oblige Marilla, but the pretty and kind Mrs.
					Allen helps Anne see that organized religion need not be painful
					or boring. For Anne, religion no longer means foreign, dull speeches
					and rules; under Mrs. Allan’s tutelage, religion becomes interesting,
					especially because Mrs. Allan allows her pupils to ask questions
					about it. Similarly, Miss Stacy’s new, liberal form of education
					allows Anne to enjoy learning for its own sake. When Anne first
					comes to Avonlea, she advances quickly in her studies in order to
					irk her rival, Gilbert, but this model of academic success depends
					largely on the presence of an enemy. Now, Anne can rely on herself
					alone. She sees that learning can be an exercise of imagination
					rather than a chore of rote memorization.

	Marilla’s affection for Anne continues to grow. When
					she sees Mr. Barry carrying Anne across the field, she realizes
					in a flash that she loves Anne more than she loves anything else
					in the world. Even what seems like unnecessary sternness is simply
					Marilla’s affection for Anne. For example, when Marilla tries to
					dampen Anne’s enthusiasm for the tea party, she does it not out
					of mean-spiritedness, but because she hates to think of Anne’s hopes
					dashed, and wants to save her from disappointment.

	Avonlea is a community caught between tradition and modernity,
					especially in its views on women. Characters such as Mrs. Rachel
					hold beliefs that seem to be in tension with one another. On the
					one hand, Mrs. Rachel feels that women should be given the right
					to vote—a liberal and progressive view. The Cuthberts, true to their
					generally conservative characters, oppose Mrs. Rachel in this belief.
					At the same time, however, Mrs. Rachel believes it “a dangerous
					innovation” for the Avonlea trustees to hire a female teacher. As women’s
					roles change, Mrs. Rachel’s contradictory views on women represent
					the Avonlea community as a whole. She does not wholly support independence
					and power for women, but she supports it in part. She believes simultaneously
					in tradition and in progress.
