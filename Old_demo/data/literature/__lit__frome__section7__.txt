For a moment such a flame of hate rose
						in him that it ran down his arm and clenched his fist against her.
						He took a wild step forward and then stopped.

	“You’re—you’re not coming down?” he said in a bewildered
						voice.	

After hanging up his coat, Ethan calls to Zeena but receives
					no reply. He goes up the stairs and opens her door, revealing a
					nearly dark room. Still wearing her traveling clothes, Zeena sits
					silently at the window. When Ethan informs her that supper is ready,
					she says she has no appetite. Zeena cuts short Ethan’s attempts
					to make small talk by announcing that she is much more ill than
					he thinks. She tells him that in the interest of preserving her
					health, she has engaged the services of a new hired girl, who will
					arrive the -following afternoon.

Ethan becomes angry at this unforeseen expense, and a
					raging war of words ensues between him and Zeena. After a bitter
					haggle regarding Zeena’s condition, in which she insists that she
					lost her health nursing his mother, Ethan resolutely declares that
					he lacks the funds to employ a hired girl. But, in so doing, he
					is caught in his own lie about the advance he had been planning
					to collect from Andrew Hale. When Zeena points out Ethan’s inconsistency,
					he is somewhat shaken. Zeena then further agitates Ethan by announcing
					that Mattie has burdened the household for too long and will have
					to leave. With Mattie’s board freed up, Zeena explains, they will
					be able to scrape together enough money for a hired girl after all.

Just at that moment, Mattie calls up from the landing
					to announce that supper is waiting. Zeena replies by declining her
					supper, and Ethan sends Mattie downstairs, promising to follow shortly.
					Turning back to Zeena, Ethan lamely attempts to defend Mattie. Zeena
					refuses to listen, proclaiming that with the hired girl’s arrival,
					Mattie must depart. Ethan fumes with hatred, but he stops himself
					from expressing it. Instead, he retreats from the bedroom as Zeena
					prepares to lie down for the night.

In the kitchen, Mattie brings a meat pie to the table,
					and she and Ethan once again sit down to supper alone. Ethan assures
					Mattie that everything is fine, but his disgust makes him unable
					to eat, and his dark mood produces a new wave of anxiety in Mattie.
					As she questions Ethan further, he rises from his seat and moves
					around the table to her side. With a trembling perplexity, Mattie
					leans toward him. As if to resolve matters, Ethan takes her into
					his arms and kisses her fully upon the lips. She remains in his
					grasp for a moment and then draws back to make sense of the situation.

With a violent outburst, Ethan declares that Mattie must
					not go. Confused at first, Mattie soon catches his meaning and realizes
					that Zeena intends for her to be replaced. After sitting in silence
					for a while, they forlornly begin to discuss Mattie’s bleak prospects
					for future employment. Filled with indignation, Ethan exclaims that
					he means to protect Mattie from dismissal and expulsion. No sooner have
					the rebellious words erupted than Mattie raises her hand in warning—Zeena
					comes in and quietly takes her seat at the table between Ethan and
					Mattie. Citing her need for nourishment despite her lack of appetite,
					Zeena starts eating her meal. Ethan sits motionless and Mattie attempts
					to make polite conversation. The cat rubs up against Zeena, and
					she strokes it and feeds it a scrap of meat.

After finishing her meal, Zeena rises from the table to
					find some old stomach powders. Mattie begins clearing the table,
					and Ethan muses that he will go outside to watch the nightfall.
					At the door, he meets an indignant Zeena on the verge of tears,
					holding the shards of the pickle dish in her hand and demanding
					an explanation. When pressed, Ethan blames the accident on the cat.
					Rushing to Ethan’s defense, Mattie explains that she had taken the
					pickle dish down to decorate the supper table. Zeena reprimands
					Mattie for her sneakiness and declares that she should have turned
					her out long ago.

The increasing gravity of Zeena’s illness—or at least
					what she claims is the increasing gravity of her
					illness—invests her with a ruthless authority in these scenes. Wharton
					compares Zeena’s discussions of her sickness with the behavior of
					someone chosen for “a great fate.” Zeena doesn’t see her ailment
					as a curse; she acts as though her ability to live with suffering
					proves her “elect” status, her virtue, and fortitude. She casts
					herself as a noble martyr, telling Ethan that although anyone else
					would need an operation given her condition, she is willing to struggle
					on without one.

Zeena’s placement of herself in the role of a martyr is
					certainly Ethan’s greatest obstacle in his attempt to keep Mattie,
					but even without Zeena claiming the higher moral ground, Ethan would
					be out of his depth. Zeena calls the shots because Mattie is her
					relative, not Ethan’s. Likewise, the domestic realm is Zeena’s concern,
					not Ethan’s. Zeena’s dominance within the household becomes obvious when
					Ethan, seething, has a sudden urge to strike at her but then inexplicably
					reverts to a state of passive bewilderment and meekness, retreating
					downstairs. Similarly, Zeena’s well-timed entrance into the kitchen
					forces Ethan back into silence just as he has finally managed to
					reveal his true feelings to Mattie.

Certainly, Ethan realizes that Zeena, a chronic hypochondriac,
					is exaggerating the severity of her illness in order to gain the
					upper hand in their relationship. Nevertheless, he remains powerless
					to oppose her. The self-possessed Zeena so carefully crafts her
					statements that, though they may be lies, Ethan cannot disprove
					them. Ethan, on the other hand, lacks grace and articulateness.
					He clumsily allows Zeena to catch him in his own lie about the lumber advance,
					and then proves unable to cover his tracks. As Wharton squarely
					notes, Ethan is no good at lying, and his natural streak of honesty
					is a factor in his eventual inability to realize his own dreams.

The broken pickle dish that Zeena discovers at the top
					of the china closet symbolizes the shattered Frome marriage. Mattie
					is partially responsible for the breaking of both the pickle dish
					and the marriage, having handled them carelessly, and Ethan cowardly hides
					the broken state of each. Significantly, though, it was the cat that
					actually destroyed the dish. Throughout the narrative, the cat is associated
					with Zeena, so the cat’s destruction of the pickle dish suggests
					that Zeena must share responsibility for the failure of her marriage.
					Zeena uses the dish as an excuse to vent anger that in fact stems
					from the disintegration of the relationships around her. She mourns
					for the destruction of the dish because she cannot openly mourn
					the collapse of her marriage and happiness.

Meanwhile, the reader is left uncertain of Mattie’s feelings, because
					Zeena’s arrival cuts short Mattie’s conversation with Ethan after
					he kisses her. We assume that she feels the same passion that Ethan
					does, but her words do not betray anything. Instead of discussing
					the kiss, she immediately turns the conversation to Zeena and the
					possibility of her own departure from the household.
