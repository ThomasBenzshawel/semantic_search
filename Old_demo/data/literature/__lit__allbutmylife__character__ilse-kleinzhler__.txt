Ilse, one of Gerda’s childhood friends, eventually becomes Gerda’s only
				family. Ilse is a talented musician who plays the piano with emotional intensity
				and gives herself entirely to her music. Although Ilse is more timid than Gerda,
				she is intensely brave in her own way and is willing to sacrifice much to assist
				her friend. She is not envious of Gerda’s good fortune when Gerda is given the
				opportunity to leave the transit camp to be with Abek’s family; rather, she is
				genuinely happy for Gerda. They hold hands constantly throughout the memoir,
				both to give each other strength and to demonstrate their unbreakable
				friendship. They are even holding hands when Ilse dies during the last week of
				the death march.

Perhaps because Gerda wrote her memoir after Ilse’s death, she attributes
				a sort of otherworldly goodness to Ilse and credits her with saving her life
				many times. She attaches great significance to the time that Ilse found a
				slightly crushed raspberry and carried it all day to give it as a gift to Gerda
				that night. This moment—when Ilse’s only possession in the world is nothing more
				than a bruised raspberry, yet she chooses to give it to her friend—provides an
				intimate view of Ilse’s character. Not only is she kind and sweet, but she is
				self-sacrificing and willing to do anything she can to help Gerda. Even on her
				deathbed, she expresses concern for her friends and her family, forcing Gerda to
				promise to live to see the end of the war, and asking that Gerda spare Ilse’s
				parents the pain of hearing that Ilse died as she did. Her character is that of
				an admirable martyr without whom Gerda would have probably not survived the
				war.
