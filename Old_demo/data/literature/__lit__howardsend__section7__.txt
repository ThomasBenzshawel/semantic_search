					Helen and Leonard discuss Henry at
					their hotel, while Jacky sleeps in another room.
					Helen regales him with theories about the concept of
					"I":  A certain kind of person, she says, is missing
					the "I" from the middle of their brains.  She says that Mr. Wilcox
					is such a person, perhaps the world will fall to such
					people, and so on.  Leonard complains that life is
					all about money, and she argues that it is not, for
					the idea of death forces people to arrive at an idea
					of real meaning.  At last, two notes arrive from
					Margaret, one for each of them.
				


					At Oniton, Margaret contemplates how to react to the
					news of Henry's decade-old affair.  She considers
					leaving him, but is motivated by love and pity to try
					to help him become a better man.  She visits him in
					the morning.  He tells her of his encounter with
					Jacky in Cyprus, where the affair occurred,
					and Margaret says that she has forgiven him.  She is
					surprised, however, to learn that both Helen and the
					Basts have left the hotel--she is worried that she
					may have blundered, for she sent Helen a very
					critical note about Leonard, and Leonard a terse note
					saying that Henry did not have work for him.
				


					Far from Oniton, Tibby is in his apartment at
					Oxford, where he is nearing his last year.
					Helen bursts in, crying and telling him all about
					Margaret, Henry, and the Basts.  Tibby is
					detached but tolerant, and agrees to carry out
					certain instructions.  Helen herself cannot bear to
					face Margaret, and so is taking a long trip to
					Germany.  She asks Tibby to give the Basts
					5,000 pounds of her money, a substantial portion
					of her fortune.  However, Leonard refuses the
					check, and by the time Helen can write to Tibby to
					urge him to try again, the Basts have been evicted
					from their apartment and have disappeared.  Helen
					reinvests her money, and becomes even richer than she
					was before.
				


					As the lease at Wickham Place nears expiration, the
					house falls into a kind of desolation; the furniture
					is all sent to Howards End, which Henry has
					generously offered as storage space.  Henry and
					Margaret are married, and go to live for a time at
					the Wilcoxes' house in London, with the intention of
					finding a bigger house soon.  Time passes, and Henry
					becomes happier and happier with his choice of
					Margaret as a wife.  She is clever, but also
					submissive, and seems to understand her place as a
					woman.  Margaret, who understands every sacrifice she
					makes for Henry, continues to be motivated partially
					by pity for him; but she also begins to be less
					interested in discussing societies, debate, and
					theater, preferring instead to reread books and think
					on her own.  Now that she has passed 30, she is
					passing "from words to things," a moment in her life
					when "some closing of the gates is inevitable...if
					the mind itself is to become a creative power."
				


					Toward the end of this section, another example
					appears of the symbolic importance of houses: the
					description of the house at Wickham Place falling
					into desolation as its inhabitants depart.  This
					underscores a feature of the emergent middle-class
					lifestyle adopted by the Wilcoxes and the Schlegels
					that Forster consistently criticizes through his
					characters:  its portability.  Helen continually
					imagines that luggage will outlive humanity, and
					Margaret mourns the impermanence of people's
					relationships with houses.  Mrs. Wilcox even
					suggests that it is a tragedy that someone would die
					in a room different from the room in which they were
					born.
				


					Helen's conversation with Leonard (which,
					unbeknownst to the reader at this point, immediately
					precedes their sexual encounter) offers an important
					thematic insight into the question of the
					relationship of the seen and the unseen, the physical
					and the spiritual.  Leonard complains that all of
					life is merely a quest for money, and Helen argues
					that it is not.  She says that if people lived
					forever, Leonard would be right, but the mere fact of
					death forces them to seek some kind of meaning in
					their lives.  Because their lives will end, they are
					forced to come to terms with the unseen and unknown.
					This realization immediately recalls Helen's previous
					observation that "goblins walk across the
					universe"--that life has no meaning and humanity has no
					greatness.  Helen's realization here seems to imply
					that what banishes the goblins is the idea of death:
					People cannot accept the goblins, because they know
					that they will die.  But this fact does not
					necessarily mean that the goblins are wrong; instead,
					it suggests that they are psychologically unsatisfying.
					As Helen realizes at the Beethoven performance, the
					goblins can return at any time, and they are
					ultimately unanswerable.
