Helmholtz Watson is not as fully developed as some of
the other characters, acting instead as a foil for Bernard and John.
For Bernard, Helmholtz is everything Bernard wishes he could be:
strong, intelligent, and attractive. As such a figure of strength,
Helmholtz is very comfortable in his caste. Unlike Bernard, he is
well liked and respected. Though he and Bernard share a dislike
of the World State, Helmholtz condemns it for radically different
reasons. Bernard dislikes the State because he is too weak to fit
the social position he has been assigned; Helmholtz because he is
too strong. Helmholtz can see and feel how the shallow culture in
which he lives is stifling him.

Helmholtz is also a foil for John, but in a different
way. Helmholtz and John are very similar in spirit; both love poetry,
and both are intelligent and critical of the World State. But there
is an enormous cultural gap between them. Even when Helmholtz sees
the genius in Shakespeare’s poetry, he cannot help but laugh at
the mention of mothers, fathers, and marriage—concepts that are
vulgar and ridiculous in the World State. The conversations between
Helmholtz and John illustrate that even the most reflective and
intelligent World State member is defined by the culture in which
he has been raised.
