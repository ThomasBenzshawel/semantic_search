Caderousse exemplifies human dissatisfaction, helping
				to illustrate that happiness depends more on attitude than on external
				circumstances. Though fate—or, more precisely, Dantès—treats Caderousse
				fairly well, he is never truly satisfied with his life. No matter how
				much he has, Caderousse always feels that he deserves more. With
				each improvement in his position, Caderousse’s desires only increase.
				He is pained by the good fortune of his friends, and his
				envy festers into hatred and ultimately into crime. Not only covetous
				but also lazy and dishonest, Caderousse consistently resorts to
				dishonorable means in order to acquire what he wants, thieving and
				even murdering in order to better his own position. Ultimately,
				Caderousse’s unending greed catches up with him, and he dies while
				trying to rob Monte Cristo.
