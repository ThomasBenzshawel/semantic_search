Hiroshima is a nonfiction work by American journalist and writer John Hersey that was first published in 1946. It describes the stories of six survivors of the August 6, 1945, atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. In one of the earliest examples of the New Journalism approach, Hersey applied techniques generally associated with fiction writing to tell the survivors’ factual stories. In 1985, Hersey returned emended Hiroshima with a new final chapter called “The Aftermath” that advances the survivors’ stories past 1946.
