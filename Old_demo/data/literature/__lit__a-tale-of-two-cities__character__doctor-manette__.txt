Dickens uses Doctor Manette to illustrate one of the dominant motifs
				of the novel: the essential mystery that surrounds every human being.
				As Jarvis Lorry makes his way toward France to recover Manette,
				the narrator reflects that “every human creature is constituted
				to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.” For much
				of the novel, the cause of Manette’s incarceration remains a mystery
				both to the other characters and to the reader. Even when the story
				concerning the evil Marquis Evrémonde comes to light, the conditions
				of Manette’s imprisonment remain hidden. Though the reader never
				learns exactly how Manette suffered, his relapses into trembling
				sessions of shoemaking evidence the depth of his misery.

Like Carton, Manette undergoes a drastic change over the
				course of the novel. He is transformed from an insensate prisoner
				who mindlessly cobbles shoes into a man of distinction. The contemporary
				reader tends to understand human individuals not as fixed entities
				but rather as impressionable and reactive beings, affected and influenced
				by their surroundings and by the people with whom they interact.
				In Dickens’s age, however, this notion was rather revolutionary.
				Manette’s transformation testifies to the tremendous impact of relationships
				and experience on life. The strength that he displays while dedicating
				himself to rescuing Darnay seems to confirm the lesson that Carton
				learns by the end of the novel—that not only does one’s treatment
				of others play an important role in others’ personal development,
				but also that the very worth of one’s life is determined by its
				impact on the lives of others.
