Day comes from the poor sector of Los Angeles, so he is socially disadvantaged as soon as he is born. Day also has a rebellious streak, which makes it hard for him to accept the Republic’s totalitarian regime. When Day is told he fails his Trial and is subjected to painful medical tests as if he were a lab rat, he escapes and goes underground, vowing to commit crimes against the dictatorial Republic. He turns to blowing up military aircraft, vandalizing public buildings, and staging bank robberies. Eventually, he becomes notorious for his ability to evade capture. The Republic has no idea what Day even looks like. He is clever, takes risks, and can easily see through the Republic’s propaganda. 

For all his criminality and hatred of the Republic, however, he goes out of his way to make sure his victims are not hurt. Day makes sure the doctor he takes hostage at the hospital ducks out of the way before he releases him, and he makes sure that the knife he throws at Metias only nicks him in the shoulder. Day’s primary motivation above all is family. Even though it would be safer for him to leave town altogether, he stays to watch over them from afar. When Day gets to know June, however, his abhorrence for government officials is challenged. It is Day’s compassion that allows him not to take his anger out on June once she reveals her betrayal and to quickly bridge the gap between them to become allies. Day follows his moral compass and judgment to carve out his own path in life.
