On a hot day, the narrator and his company had erected a barricade across a bridge. It was too heavy to lift but perfect to shoot around. The enemies tried to get around it and rush it, with no success. Finally, though, the company got word that their flank had gone, so they had to retreat. They were disappointed.

This vignette corresponds to Nick Adams's relationship with Marjorie in "The End of Something." The idea of this mini-story is that one can never anticipate when a fantastically built structure will become useless. Nick's relationship with Marjorie is similar because Nick seems to love her and the times that they have had together. Yet, something has changed so that he feels that he has to leave her, despite the fun that they have had together.
