The loyal Sam consistently serves as a foil to all of
				the grandeur and earthshaking events that take place in The
					Lord of the Rings. Some readers may find Sam’s folksy wisdom
				and extreme devotion to Frodo somewhat cloying, but these traits
				do allow Tolkien to keep a little bit of the flavor of the Shire
				with the Fellowship as it moves toward the dark land of Mordor.
				Sam is much more the typical Hobbit than Frodo, though Sam, too,
				displays a great curiosity about the world beyond the Shire, especially
				Elves. Sam is shy and somewhat awkward socially, but he is ferocious
				in a fight and clever and quick on his feet. His speech consistently
				has a modest, awestruck tone. Tolkien, for instance, speaks through
				Sam when he wishes to capture the particular grace of the Elves
				simply and directly. Sam also serves as a foil for Frodo’s melancholy
				and fatalism. When Frodo becomes increasingly preoccupied with the
				great burden of the Ring, he comes to rely more and more on Sam
				for help. Indeed, throughout even the lowest and most hopeless points
				of the journey, Sam remains relentlessly pragmatic and optimistic.
				If it is Frodo’s duty to “carry” the Ring, it is often Sam’s duty
				to carry Frodo.
