Lieutenant Nun is an autobiography that was written by Catalina de Erauso around 1626 and first published in 1829. It describes the amazing life of a Basque woman who fled from a convent in 1600, disguised herself as a man, and traveled to South America where she eventually became soldier in the Spanish army. After telling her story and returning to Spain, she became a famous and either wrote or supervised the writing of her picaresque-style memoirs—which would be published two centuries later—before returning to New Spain.
