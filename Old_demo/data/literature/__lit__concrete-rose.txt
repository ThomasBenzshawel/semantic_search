Concrete Rose is a young adult novel by award-winning author Angie Thomas. Debuting at No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list in 2021, Concrete Rose is a prequel to The Hate U Give, Thomas’ debut novel. Concrete Rose tells the story of a high school senior and gang member, Maverick Carter, and the social and economic challenges of growing up as a Black man. The name Concrete Rose comes from Tupac Shakur’s collection of poetry “The Rose That Grew from Concrete,” which examines the life of a boy in difficult circumstances, the choices made, and their lasting consequences.
