It also serves up research-based advice on how individuals can motivate others to rethink their seemingly fixed ideas and attitudes.

Think Again was released to critical acclaim just as the Covid pandemic was provoking mass rethinking about business practices and social interactions. At a time when information technology enables echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs, Think Again, which encourages open-mindedness and mental flexibility, has been praised as a significant contribution to the cultural dialogue on critical thinking and personal growth.
