Willem Ragnarsson is a great actor because he lacks a strong sense of identity. Many people would find this a source of insecurity, but Willem treats it as an opportunity to root himself in the soil of his choice. When asked about his best characteristic, he describes his friends and his kindness toward them. As an actor, this translates into him wanting the best for his audience, giving the best to his director and his co-workers while remaining humble in the face of his success. Like Jude, Willem is untethered. He is the child of immigrants who, once they raised him, believed that their responsibility to him was fulfilled. He accepts this reality without bitterness and laments only the loss of his older brother Hemming. Although Hemming, who had cerebral palsy, was treated like a chore by their parents, Willem saw his brother as a deeply important person and a source of love, the same way that he sees Jude. The friends’ biggest difference is that Willem feels rooted and content in the friend and family group he has established for himself, which is a quality for which Jude strives but cannot attain.
